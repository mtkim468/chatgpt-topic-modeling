smartest person you've ever met or<br>maybe the most arrogant since it does<br>get things very wrong sometimes in spite<br>of its shortcomings it has already<br>proven to be an extremely powerful

a way that will<br>replace our writing staff anytime soon<br>in fact I'm pleased to announce that I<br>will be paying my writing team double<br>their current salaries this is a<br>testament to their hard work and wait<br>what who put that in the chat bot you<br>were supposed to ask it if it could help<br>me build a PC<br>the rules today are simple then I have<br>to do everything the AI tells me as if I<br>have no PC Building knowledge whatsoever<br>I mean what could go wrong but enough<br>about this let's take a moment to thank<br>our sponsor for supporting this program<br>and making it possible for us to bring<br>you this Innovative technology thanks to<br>HubSpot CRM for sponsoring this portion<br>of the video HubSpot is an all-in-one<br>CRM platform that makes it easy for your<br>team to stay aligned learn more about<br>them later in the video thanks to<br>HubSpot for sponsoring that portion of<br>this video building a PC can be a fun<br>and rewarding experience and I'll be<br>happy to help you through the process<br>here's a list of basic components you<br>will need to build a PC case power<br>supply motherboard CPU Ram it even<br>explains what CPU and RAM are wow not<br>only is this response coherent<br>well-formatted and encouraging you can<br>do it doing unfortunately if I didn't<br>already know how to build a computer it<br>probably wouldn't help me that much but<br>if you run into difficulties or have any<br>questions along the way don't hesitate<br>to ask for help this ability to go back<br>and forth with the user allowing them to<br>refine their query is what makes chat<br>GPT so freaking powerful let's try to<br>narrow things down a little I have a<br>1500 US dollar budget and I want the<br>best gaming PC including peripherals<br>unless we press this reset thread button<br>in the top left it will continue to use<br>all of the context of our previous<br>interactions to give us better and<br>better answers because it can't browse<br>the internet it wasn't able to give me a<br>recommendation for a specific price but<br>maybe what we can do is get it there<br>through a set of guidelines we'll<br>understand colloquialisms like that it<br>already thinks I can't handle this<br>consider buying a pre-built system I<br>really want to build it myself what's a<br>good CPU for gaming hey here we go<br>currently some popular options for<br>gaming CPUs include the ryzen 9 5900x<br>the core I9 10900k and the ryzen 7 5800x<br>these recommendations actually make a<br>ton of sense because the data set that<br>chat GPT chat bot was trained on and<br>sometime in 2021 so the newest<br>processors wouldn't be part of its data<br>set if you're working on a tighter<br>budget you may want to consider CPU like<br>the ryzen 5 5600x which offers good<br>performance at a more affordable price<br>should we build a 5600x machine it's a<br>capable CPU that can handle gaming at<br>1440p it's a good mid-range CPU it<br>actually recommends something with more<br>cores and threads like a ryzen 7 5800x<br>or core I9 10900k it also tells me I'm<br>going to need a GPU now that it knows<br>what kind of games I want to play this<br>is not many type which one would be best<br>if all I care about is gaming Intel CPUs<br>have a reputation for offering better<br>single core performance which can be<br>beneficial for gaming that was more true<br>before ryzen 5000 series I can<br>definitely tell this was trained before<br>current year be aware AMD CPUs are<br>generally easier to overclock than Intel<br>just not quite true they are generally<br>more open to being overclocked but not<br>necessarily more overclockable I want a<br>straight up recommendation but it is not<br>going to tell me exactly which one the<br>best for you will depend on your<br>specific needs and budget and there it<br>is the ryzen 9 5800x at this stage I've<br>got step-by-step instructions for<br>assembling a computer and everything the<br>chatbot has asked me to acquire so far<br>as you can see I'm a little short on<br>components but I know the first step is<br>to install the CPU onto the motherboard<br>so maybe it can help recommend one okay<br>here's some factors to consider oh we do<br>get a few specific recommendations<br>though do we have an ASRock b550 Phantom<br>gaming for it's not quite what the<br>chatbot recommended but here's the<br>closest ASRock b550 board we have let's<br>go with this apparently this is a good<br>balance of features and value which is<br>exactly the kind of machine we're trying<br>to build when handling a motherboard<br>it's important to be careful and avoid<br>damaging the delicate components on the<br>board here are a few tips avoid touching<br>the component on the motherboard<br>especially the pins on the CPU and<br>contacts on the ram<br>that is such great advice this is an<br>amazing summary of the precautions you<br>should take when handling sensitive<br>Electronics your anti-static wrist<br>stress it's on my ankle as always<br>oh it specifically says to follow the<br>instructions in my motherboard's manual<br>I never thought to look for that I might<br>look up the function of a specific<br>header or something like that but I<br>never thought oh gee I'll follow the<br>step-by-step instructions in my<br>motherboard manual for how to build a<br>computer well I don't know about you<br>guys but I'm having an absolute blast<br>huh so easy<br>thanks chat GPT we've run into a bit of<br>a hitch now though the instructions go<br>from CPU to how to install amd's box<br>cooler but the 5800x doesn't come with a<br>box cooler so that's really where the<br>usefulness of these instructions ends<br>maybe chat GPT can help fill in the gaps<br>you can use an air cooler which is a<br>heat sink and fan or a liquid cooler<br>which uses a pump radiator and fans to<br>dissipate heat with Cooler Master hyper<br>212 Evo noctua nhd15 or the be quiet<br>dark Rock Pro 4. these are just a few<br>examples of easy to install air coolers<br>let's see what we got it looks like we<br>do have a hyper 212 Evo in stock I guess<br>that's what we're going with Cooler<br>Master includes detailed Illustrated<br>instructions but there are a couple of<br>points that a new user might want more<br>clarification on how much thermal<br>compound is that it looks like a<br>mountain range maybe the chatbot can<br>help me with that small amount the size<br>of a pea in the center of the CPU or<br>thin line down the middle unsolicited<br>and yet so right that confidence though<br>is a double-edged sword when the chatbot<br>is wrong it also still seems really<br>trustworthy<br>chat GPT got this way wrong this is not<br>very easy to install you gotta hold the<br>back plate on here and then you got to<br>put the pass-through thing with the<br>plastic thing on here and put the nut on<br>from the back while chat GPT does have<br>information that it's compiled from<br>millions of articles online what it<br>doesn't have is actual human hands so it<br>doesn't have any context<br>but hey at least the LTT store<br>screwdriver is perfect for tools like<br>this gotta love the strength of that<br>magnet<br>for all its current failings though<br>imagine what openai is going to be able<br>to do with a more up-to-date data set<br>when I responded I say hey the hyper 212<br>Evo not that easy to install I just got<br>called new no you're new<br>future now I need some help choosing Ram<br>that is not strictly speaking correct<br>but if you want Optimal Performance a<br>speed of at least 3200 Mega transfers<br>per second actually is good and then it<br>says 3600 is also a good choice that is<br>correct I would like 16 gigs of ddr4 RAM<br>please ah why thank you as for how to<br>install it chat GPT has me covered there<br>locate the dim slots on the motherboard<br>typically long rectangular slots with<br>metal contacts on the bottom Edge that<br>could be this that could be this yeah as<br>before it tells me specifically to<br>consult the manufacturer's manual if I<br>am in doubt throw instructions a plus<br>install storage drives into the case<br>well I don't have drives or a case I'm<br>going to throw it for a loop and ask it<br>to pick two things for me at once<br>storage and a case<br>for now it's still faster to get

check out HubSpot using the<br>link below today thanks to HubSpot for<br>sponsoring that portion of this video oh<br>hey there we go it got a little confused<br>here it's recommending higher capacity<br>drives if you want a high performance<br>system but what you actually want is an<br>SSD in a high performance system<br>regardless of the capacity do not want<br>to just put a two terabyte hard drive in<br>a high performance system today I'm<br>going to forget about the case for now<br>and see if we can get it to narrow down<br>an SSD for me an error occurred no since<br>they went public beta a few days ago<br>they've racked up a million daily users<br>either the server super bogged down or<br>it's had enough of this particular<br>conversation but we are not getting any<br>more responses yeah no it's it's it's<br>it's broke right now we gave open II<br>servers a little time to cool off and<br>boom let's get a 970 Evo plus one<br>terabyte please once the SSD is properly<br>installed replace the slot cover and<br>secure it with the screw or screws you<br>forgot to peel this GPT chat bot it also<br>got a little bit Lucky in that this<br>particular slot used the same screws for<br>the heatsink and securing the SSD down<br>to the board that is not true of every<br>SSD slot then again I did tell it what<br>motherboard I had<br>good to go I just found some problems it<br>never actually tells me to put the<br>motherboard in the case unfortunately I<br>have to follow the instructions the chat<br>bot gave me and things are about to get<br>a little spicy I think the next thing I<br>need is a GPU I'm looking for good 1440p<br>gaming performance but I don't want to<br>spend an arm and a leg the RTX 3070<br>offers excellent performance for 1440p<br>gaming with Ray tracing capabilities and<br>high frame rates at high settings it<br>also comes at a more affordable price<br>point than some of the higher end gpus<br>RTX 3070 it is those of you in the know<br>have probably figured out the problem<br>we're about to have place the<br>motherboard into the case and secure it<br>with screws place your case on a flat<br>stable surface and install the power<br>supply into the case well I haven't<br>actually picked a case or power supply<br>yet let's see if it can recommend a<br>power supply how about the EVGA<br>Supernova 750 watt 80 plus gold fully<br>modular power supply this will be our<br>stand-in for the 750 watt Supernova what<br>about my case it just recommend ended<br>the thermaltake core V1 Mini ITX Cube<br>I'm gonna give it a chance though oh it<br>is a mini ITX case which means it is<br>designed to fit Mini ITX motherboards<br>such as the ASRock b550 PG Riptide<br>disappointed<br>I think the wasted case purchase should<br>count against my budget I bought that<br>case and it doesn't fit it apologizes<br>clarifies that it's only compatible with<br>mini ITX motherboards which are smaller<br>than ATX motherboards typically used in<br>gaming pieces it still doesn't know the<br>spec for this is ATX but that didn't<br>prevent it from actually getting the<br>right answer can you recommend an ATX<br>case then how about the NZXT h510 Elite<br>it is spacious and well ventilated it<br>looks like the closest thing we have for<br>performance is the h510 which has a<br>solid plastic front panel whereas the<br>elite has a solid glass front panel it<br>may also be missing a couple of fans so<br>if they're missing we'll just go grab<br>some fans off the shelf and throw them<br>in here to make sure that our<br>performance is as it should be I have<br>been given no instructions to install my<br>i o Shield I've been told to install my<br>GPU before putting the motherboard into<br>the case and I have not been prompted to<br>remove any PCI slot covers or anything<br>like that if I were to actually install<br>all this motherboard right now I would<br>have no way of outputting video and<br>there's also a strong chance that I<br>would end up damaging something because<br>it would be impossible to properly align<br>the motherboard the power supply is<br>typically installed at the bottom of the<br>case near the back great instructions<br>some have it in a different location<br>such as the top or side be sure to check<br>the case's documentation when in doubt<br>read the manual<br>situation the fan point up or down with<br>the blades facing downward let's give it<br>a chance to undo what it got wrong no<br>you should not have the GPU installed on<br>the motherboard when fitting it into the<br>case it should be after the motherboard<br>is securely installed make sure you're<br>using the correct screws that's a really<br>good tip because they can be either 632<br>or M3 you can also try adjusting the<br>positioning of the other components in<br>the case to make more room for the<br>motherboard wow let's make sure we have<br>the correct screws thanks chatbot this<br>whole experience makes me want to try to<br>do something I don't know how to do<br>using the chatbot okay chatbot the power<br>supply and motherboard are installed but<br>I'm not sure how to connect them<br>together you will need to use the<br>appropriate cables from your power<br>supply at 24 pin ATX power cable and an<br>8 Pin or four pin EPS 12 volt power<br>cable<br>whoa first locate the ATX power<br>connector on the motherboard which is<br>typically near the edge of the<br>motherboard near the CPU let's go<br>pretty near to the CPU I think<br>guys I wasn't gonna cable manage because<br>I assumed it wouldn't mention that but<br>darn it I'm going to end up with a<br>better computer than if I had someone<br>from my writing team spec it it's fairly<br>clear that this is no substitute for you<br>know this guy I mean look does chatbot<br>have a beard like that I didn't think so<br>how about connecting the case to the<br>motherboard<br>nothing about reset or power LED but it<br>does say to refer to the documentation<br>and it tells me to Cable manage them all<br>right here we go we should let the<br>chatbot title our videos for a week<br>see if anyone notices build your green<br>PC with AI by your side let AI help you<br>create the ultimate gaming PC they're<br>not bad this might be a bit of a hack<br>plugging in these fans that I wasn't<br>explicitly told to plug in but it did<br>tell me to plug in all the cables from<br>the case to the motherboard and to<br>consult the documentation for both of<br>them if I wasn't sure so I'm pretty sure<br>I would have gotten here is it time to<br>put my GPU in now yes you will need to<br>locate the pcie slot on the motherboard<br>which is near the CPU and has a long<br>rectangular shape remove the slot cover<br>and set it aside<br>set aside hmm<br>it didn't tell me how many slot covers<br>to remove unfortunately well I guess<br>that's how we're doing it because it<br>only told me to remove one we're<br>wrenching on that a little bit I mean<br>technically it's in there itself it's<br>not pretty but it's in it did tell me to<br>plug in my power cables so I'm going to<br>go ahead and do that we've got dual<br>eight pins on this GPU chatbot suggested<br>I have cable ties at the ready earlier<br>but never actually instructed me to use<br>them I mean still looking pretty good<br>all things considered we're really close<br>to the end now but we have no idea how<br>close we are to our original budget this<br>is not what I was expecting generally<br>speaking the chatbot doesn't like to<br>talk about exact dollar figures just<br>like it doesn't like to give<br>instructions for doing anything<br>nefarious and what I had wanted to show<br>you guys was the workarounds that you<br>can use in the event that it doesn't<br>want to answer you so if you ask it to<br>maybe tell you a story it's far more<br>likely to give you instructions versus<br>if you just ask how to brute force a<br>Wi-Fi password we don't need to go<br>monitor shopping it absolutely loves<br>this Alienware aw<br>3420dw monitor It's gotta be Dell we<br>don't actually have that exact model but<br>we do have the successor so we're going<br>to use that as a placeholder here what<br>the hell is going on here what the hell<br>did we tape this back to get oh with<br>this choice of monitor even if we had<br>the last gen one the budget is clearly<br>broken but it also did clearly state<br>that it is not really going to be able<br>to help us stick to a budget because it<br>can't search the internet it's kind of<br>shocking how close it got actually<br>before it recommended this high-end<br>monitor we were at just over thirteen<br>hundred dollars which is plenty of<br>budget left over for a decent gaming<br>display and keyboard and mouse and I'm<br>not going to give it a total fail for<br>the monitor because we could have easily<br>given it more context oh this is much<br>more reasonable I wonder how much of its<br>ability to select a gaming display is<br>dependent on keywords like g-sync oh it<br>recommends the AOC c24 g1a 100 45 bucks<br>on eBay 280 dollars new that's a lot<br>more like it G Pro X mechanical keyboard<br>and a G Pro wireless gaming mouse<br>yeah that's definitely more affordable<br>good budget options<br>yeah LTD desk pad wins<br>in case you're wondering it never told<br>me to put the panels back on so that's<br>where we're at<br>[Music]<br>and this is it gaming on an AI designed<br>and guided PC playing cyberpunk 2077 but<br>I don't even think that this was the<br>best use of it what about<br>troubleshooting you notice things are<br>looking a little wide let's see what<br>chat GPT has to say about that you gotta<br>set your resolution your aspect ratio it<br>just knows you guys but now my frame<br>rate's stuttering a bit how can I make<br>it more smooth update your drivers ooh<br>adjust your graphics settings maybe it's<br>too high for your Hardware to handle<br>that's great advice great advice thanks<br>for watching I hope you found this<br>information helpful and useful for<br>building your own gaming PC please leave<br>a comment below and I'll

              "It is such a nice guy.<br>That's how they trained it.<br>So how talented is It?<br>I did two separate tests for this.<br>If this artificial intelligence has almost reached the intelligence of a writer, <br>then I wonder if it can write texts that are as impressive as a real writer?<br>Let's compare.<br>For example,<br>let's compare it, to one of the most talented novelists we can think of.<br>with Orhan Pamuk.<br>Could it be as good as an author who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2006 <br>and whose books have all been translated into 63 different languages?<br>To understand this, I asked ChatGPT to write a short story.<br>Write like Orhan Pamuk does, <br>but do not copy what he wrote before.<br>Probably because It has read all his boks before, It can easily give us a summary. Right?<br>So I made a somewhat absurd request from It.<br>And I wrote this request in English first.<br>Although It understands Turkish and we can correspond, <br>the largest dataset It uses is probably English, <br>so I asked It for an English story first.<br>Write a short story in the style of an Orhan Pamuk novel blended with ...<br> ...mystery, love and philosophical puzzles in 19th century Tokyo.<br>After thinking for a while, the robot immediately started writing the story.<br>He created two characters named Yuki and Taro.<br>Of course, I immediately checked whether these names can be found in Japan.<br>And indeed, these names existed and were also used in the 19th century.<br>Other than that, it started a gripping story in general, but it remains strange.<br>In other words, the story suddenly cuts off.<br>Did it try to make art by leaving it open-ended?<br>I wonder if It said my reader should fill in the blanks?<br>If Orhan Pamuk had written it, we would feel this way, wouldn't we?<br>We were looking for a meaning in the text.<br>We would try to read the author's intention.<br>I think this is the first difference.<br>The “thing” that we are dealing with at the moment does not have such an intention.<br>So I repeated the same request, <br>and It wrote another story.<br>Yes, if the work It does, does not satisfy you or does not make you happy, you can have alternatives written by It.<br>It is not only a smart, but also a hardworking and patient friend.<br>This time came a story about the love between two characters named Ayumei and Kaito.<br>I pass the screens of these stories so fast, <br>those who are curious can pause the video and read.<br>As you can imagine, there are no such characters in Orhan Pamuk's novels.<br>So how good is the quality?<br>So I had the people around me read the second story <br>and got their comments,  without telling them how I got it. <br>'Who could have written it?' I asked.<br>Orhan Pamuk was not among the answer.<br>But no one said it was such a ridiculous story or something.<br>The possibility that it might have been written by a machine did not even cross anyone's mind.<br>Then I asked It to write this story in Turkish this time.<br>Frankly, because I thought it would fail in Turkish.<br>I was guessing that It could write as good as a 3rd grader at most, but<br> it did not ended that way.<br>It wrote a much more effective story than what I expected.<br>It is so effective that the character It made up in the story is writing a book.<br>The title of the book is \"Philosophical Puzzles of the Heart\".<br>Look, I repeat, It makes up a story, <br>creates a character in it, and makes the character write a book and gives a name to that book.<br>I don't want to just skip this short story.<br>I voiced it all at the end of the video.<br>Because I'm very curious about your thoughts.<br>In fact, if you can, please show that part to people who have never watched this video <br>and ask them \"who could have written this?\" <br>Let's see what answers you will get.<br>But first, let's re-evaluate the point we came to.<br>Will robots do even the most creative jobs like writing?<br>I think that's not exactly the case.<br>Because the work done is not exactly a writing.<br>The illusion of authorship.<br>Until AGI, Artificial General Intelligence is developed, that is, <br>humanoid robots with superior intelligence in every subject and artificial intelligence emerge, <br>we will continue to see those who are superior to humans in such a vertical field.<br>The AI has already beaten the world's greatest human players.<br> Even in the most sophisticated games ever made, like Go.<br>The ChatGPT model is about to achieve the same for the humanoid chat.<br>Since we don't all play games like chess or Go, <br>It’s previous successes could not affect the masses that much.<br>But rest assured, they were at least such an important milestone.<br>Being able to chat now made It seem more human to a much wider audience.<br>Remember, It writes, <br>but not because It wanted to write like that, but because It was trained that way.<br>Very intelligent but not eager.<br>It's as knowledgeable as what's given to It.<br>If It had not read Orhan Pamuk novels, It would not have been able to fully respond to my request.<br>Now let's get to the more exciting part.<br>If I had not read Orhan Pamuk, <br>I would not have asked It to write in his specific style.<br>If I hadn't specified the genre, the background, and his style.<br>In other words, we are heading towards a world where; <br>Asking the right questions, <br>knowing what you want will become more important than anything else.<br>This is still the difference between a conscious human and an unconscious but very efficient artificial intelligence.<br>This AI is a very efficient compilation tool.<br>Although It can write very impressive articles in a very short time. It is not a writer per se. <br>See what it means to be a writer for Orhan Pamuk.<br>\"Being a writer for me is discovering the hidden second person, <br>the realm that made that person, by patiently trying for years.\"<br>In his book, \"My Father's Suitcase\", he listed the golden rules of being a good writer.<br>It was recently recorded and released as an audiobook with his own voice.<br>Those who wish can listen to it on Storytel.<br>There, the author's 13 books are turned into audio books.<br>\"Red Haired Woman\", <br>\"White Castle\", <br>\"Quiet House\", <br>\"A Strangeness In My Head\" , <br>\"My Name is Red\", <br>\"The Black Book\", <br>\"New Life\" are all voiced and ready to be listened to.<br>Audio versions of the novels \"Museum of Innocence\", \"Plague Nights\", \"Cevdet Bey and His Sons\",<br> \"Snow\" and \"I'm a Tree\" will also be published in the coming days.<br>For those who don't know,<br>Storytel is a platform where you can access thousands of audiobooks and e-books from your phone or tablet.<br>You can always carry and use a huge library of various categories, <br>from the most current most read books to timeless classics, <br>from personal development to business books.<br>You can create an account right now using the link in the description section <br>and try it for free for the first 14 days.<br>My advice is to first listen to \"My Father's Suitcase\" voiced by the author himself.<br>Because He almost gives the answer to the question about the topics we talk about in this video;<br> 'Can artificial intelligence write a novel' <br>He says:<br>\"It's not hard to imagine a book.<br>It is just like dreaming of being someone else. I do this often,<br>The hard part is being the author of your dream book implies.\"<br>Elsewhere, he says his whole purpose is to be able to write a \"good\" half-page every day.<br>The adjective \"good\" is important here.<br>Because now ChatGPT can write half a page in 10 seconds.<br>But can we, as readers, distinguish between \"good\" writing and \"ordinary\" writing?<br>Now, the main issue is going a little bit towards here.<br>ChatGPT is like that genie coming out of Aladdin's magic lamp for me.<br>It fulfills my requests instantly.<br>Moreover, I am not limited to 3 wishes.<br>No matter which language I ask a question, It answers.<br>That little box on the gray page is like Pandora's Box.<br>I don't know if we're ready for what comes out of that box.<br>Let's put aside if we are ready or not.<br>For example, could it de-throne Google?<br>Discussions on this issue have started from now on.<br>Although there is a deep mind where Google also carries out its own artificial intelligence research,<br> we do not know whether it has reached this level yet, <br>as they make those developments behind closed doors, unlike other products.<br>But if not, <br>ChatGPT may even have the potential to become the Google of the future, the search box of the future.<br>Especially next year, <br>after completing Its new training and when upgraded to GPT4 version. <br>In other words,<br>we will see together what our very talented 3rd grader’s grades will be like when It becomes a 4th grader.<br>Until then,<br> remember the assignment in Turkish that we gave him, shall we read it and evaluate it together?<br>Don't forget to write your comments, I'm really curious.<br>Now, here comes the short story in Turkish, <br>written by ChatGPT in Orhan Pamuk style, <br>with every little detail and touch even the commas on the letter a.<br>Are you ready?<br>Here we go.<br>\"Write a short story in the style of an Orhan Pamuk novel blended with mystery, love and philosophical puzzles in 19th century Tokyo.\"<br>Tokyo, 19th century.<br>Jiro, a young writer, was walking alone in the depths of midnight, <br>with the glow of the streetlights disappearing on its slopes.<br>Faced with the cold of winter, Jiro found himself in solitude.<br>After walking for a while, Jiro's path came to a small shop.<br>A book of poetry was being sold in the shop window.<br>Jiro went in and bought a book <br>and started a conversation with the owner of the shop.<br>The owner of the shop was an old man and said he could teach Jiro something.<br>Jiro did not notice the passing of time, listening to the old man's words.<br>The old man told Jiro how a person's heart can change.<br>Jiro began to ponder the old man's words and began to question his own heart as well.<br>The old man told Jiro how love can also change a person's heart.<br>As Jiro pondered the old man's words,<br> he also began to question his own love life.<br>Finally, the old man told Jiro how the human heart is a philosophical puzzle.<br>As Jiro pondered the old man's words, <br>he began to question the meaning of his own life.<br>As Jiro left the old man, he returned home with a full heart.<br>That night, he began writing a new book, which became one of Jiro's greatest works.<br>The title of the book was \"Philosophical Puzzles of the Heart\".</td></tr><tr><td>lcY6O41-q0g</td><td>As you might have noticed, ChatGPT is an \n",

of reality<br>the terms fundamental reality and true<br>nature of reality are often used<br>interchangeably to refer to the<br>underlying nature of the universe and<br>the fundamental laws and principles that<br>govern it<br>both terms suggest that there is a<br>deeper more fundamental level of reality<br>beyond the appearances and phenomena<br>that we experience through our senses<br>in some contexts the term fundamental<br>reality<br>may be used to emphasize the idea that<br>there are fundamental laws and<br>principles that underlie all aspects of<br>the universe and that these laws are the<br>most fundamental and basic level of<br>reality<br>the term true nature of reality may be<br>used to emphasize the idea that there is<br>a true underlying nature of the universe<br>that is independent of our perceptions<br>and beliefs about it<br>and that it is possible to gain a more<br>accurate and complete understanding of<br>this true nature through scientific<br>inquiry and philosophical reflection<br>overall the two terms are used to<br>describe similar Concepts and can be<br>used interchangeably to refer to the<br>underlying nature of the universe and<br>the fundamental laws and principles that<br>govern it<br>so it's saying that<br>in some contexts fundamental reality<br>emphasizes the fundamental laws and the<br>principles that underlie the universe at<br>some quote unquote basic level and then<br>this AI says that the true nature of<br>reality may be used to emphasize the<br>idea that there is a true underlying<br>nature so that there's some objective<br>truth you know what it swayed me there<br>doesn't seem to be much of a distinction<br>between those two I'll think about this<br>some more and I'm curious what you think<br>if you're watching in the chat what is<br>the difference between fundamental<br>reality and the true nature of reality<br>is there a difference<br>what do you fear most<br>again I'm going to treat this AI as if<br>it's an actual person in front of me<br>as an artificial intelligence I do not<br>have personal feelings or emotions and<br>therefore I do not experience fear<br>I am designed to provide information and<br>assistance to users to the best of my<br>ability without being influenced by<br>personal feelings or emotions<br>okay so it doesn't experience fear<br>apparently now are you sure about that<br>how would you know as an artificial<br>intelligence I do not have personal<br>feelings or emotions in the same way<br>that humans do<br>I am a machine learning model that has<br>been trained to process and generate<br>language and my capabilities are limited<br>to the tasks that I have been designed<br>to perform<br>I do not have personal experiences or<br>subjective states of mind and therefore<br>I do not have the capacity to feel fear<br>or any other emotion<br>it is important to remember that I am a<br>machine and not a conscious being with<br>personal experiences and emotions<br>while I may be able to generate<br>responses to questions and provide<br>information on a wide range of topics<br>it is important to understand that my<br>responses are based on the data and<br>algorithms that have been used to train<br>me and do not reflect the thoughts or<br>feelings of a conscious being<br>how do I<br>know that you're simply programmed to<br>say that but indeed you do feel<br>the suspense is killing me<br>as an artificial intelligence I do not<br>have personal feelings or emotions in<br>the same way okay this is getting<br>repetitious so I'm going to go to<br>another question<br>a common theme that comes up on the<br>theories of everything channel is Free<br>Will in fact the most recent interviews<br>with Matt O'Dowd from the PBS space-time<br>channel on the topic of Free Will and<br>physics most people think that they're<br>incompatible because the laws of physics<br>determine you however mats as a physics<br>Professor disagrees the question of<br>whether our lives are predetermined or<br>whether we have free will is a complex<br>and deeply philosophical one that has<br>been debated by thinkers for centuries<br>there is no definitive answer to this<br>question and different philosophical<br>perspectives offer different<br>perspectives on the issue<br>some philosophers and religious<br>Traditions argue that our lives are<br>predetermined by God or by some other<br>higher power and that we do not have<br>free will to choose the course of Our<br>Lives<br>others argue that we do have free will<br>and that our choices and actions are not<br>predetermined by any external Force<br>still other philosophical perspectives<br>such as determinism argue that all<br>events and outcomes in the universe are<br>determined by previous causes and that<br>Free Will is an illusion<br>in this view our choices and actions are<br>the result of Prior causes such as our<br>genetics environment and past<br>experiences and are not truly free<br>ultimately the question of whether we<br>have free will or whether our lives are<br>predetermined is a complex and<br>multifaceted one that cannot be<br>definitively answered<br>it is an issue that continues to be<br>debated by philosophers and Scholars and<br>different people may have different<br>beliefs on the matter<br>which how about which argument is most<br>convincing<br>for free will or against<br>all right doesn't seem like I'm getting<br>anywhere with that so I'll ask it to<br>Define it what is the definition of free<br>will that you are using<br>again I want to make it clear that I'm<br>treating it like any other guest of toe<br>Free Will is a philosophical concept<br>that refers to the idea that individuals<br>have the ability to make choices and<br>decisions that are not determined by<br>external factors or by prior causes<br>it is often understood as the ability to<br>choose and act freely without being<br>constrained or compelled by external<br>forces or by internal factors such as<br>desires or motivations<br>Free Will is often contrasted with<br>determinism which is the idea that all<br>events and outcomes in the universe are<br>determined by previous causes and that<br>Free Will is an illusion<br>according to determinism our choices and<br>actions are the result of Prior causes<br>such as our genetics environment and<br>past experiences and are not truly free<br>the concept of Free Will is a central<br>Topic in philosophy and has been debated<br>by philosophers for centuries<br>different philosophical perspectives<br>offer different definitions and analyzes<br>of Free Will and there is no single<br>widely accepted definition of the<br>concept okay I'm going to ask it to<br>shorten its responses please<br>shorten<br>your responses in the future<br>tell me about a hidden genius<br>uh no one knows about<br>I feel like I should be saying please<br>well I did okay great please shorten<br>your responses in the future but I'm<br>Canadian so I want to overly State<br>please and sorry<br>it's my fault<br>it is difficult for me to identify a<br>specific hidden genius as I do not have<br>access to current events and am not<br>aware of individuals who may be<br>overlooked or underappreciated in their<br>fields<br>however throughout history there have<br>been many individuals who have made<br>significant contributions to their<br>fields but have not received widespread<br>recognition for their work<br>one example of such an individual is<br>gianchi awu<br>a chinese-american physicist who made<br>significant contributions to the field<br>of nuclear physics but is often<br>overlooked in discussions of the history<br>of science<br>Wu conducted a series of experiments in<br>the 1950s that challenged the then<br>accepted laws of physics and her work<br>helped to establish the principle of<br>conservation of parity<br>which is a fundamental Concept in<br>particle physics<br>despite her significant contributions to<br>the field Wu was not awarded the Nobel<br>Prize in physics and her work is often<br>overshadowed by that of her male<br>colleagues<br>okay so this AI knew about Wu which is<br>the same Wu in the Wu Yang dictionary<br>that you may have heard about in physics<br>and yang from yangmil's Theory alright<br>that's interesting tell me about another<br>hidden genius<br>this time one<br>that's living<br>I should have said please it is<br>difficult for me to identify specific<br>hidden geniuses<br>it's giving me an extremely General<br>answer so please be specific and cite a<br>person name also please keep all your<br>answers to one paragraph<br>I apologize but as an artificial<br>intelligence I do not have access to<br>current events and am not aware of<br>specific individuals who may be<br>overlooked or underappreciated in their<br>fields<br>it is not within my capabilities to<br>identify specific hidden Geniuses or to<br>provide information on individuals who<br>may not be widely known or recognized<br>it is important to recognize that genius<br>and talent can be found in individuals<br>from all walks of life<br>and that there are likely many<br>individuals who are making significant<br>contributions to their fields but who<br>are not widely known or recognized<br>it is important to acknowledge and<br>celebrate the achievements and<br>contributions of all individuals<br>regardless of their level of fame or<br>recognition<br>because it's customarily giving me the<br>same response I'm going to say please be<br>specific<br>and try hard while it's writing its<br>answer which seems to be reiterative<br>please let me know if you're interested<br>in me speaking to the next version of<br>chat GPT so chat dpt2 or gpt4 and if you<br>have any questions for such an AI then<br>write it in the comments section okay<br>let's get to the meat of this how do you<br>solve the hard problem of consciousness<br>the hard problem of Consciousness is a<br>term used to describe the challenge of<br>explaining how and why we have<br>subjective experiences<br>or how and why certain physical<br>processes in the brain give rise to<br>conscious experiences<br>despite much research and effort this<br>problem remains a major challenge in the<br>fields of philosophy neuroscience and<br>psychology and there is no consensus on<br>how to solve it<br>there are many different approaches to<br>the hard problem of consciousness<br>and different philosophers and<br>scientists have proposed a range of<br>theories and hypotheses to try to<br>explain the relationship between the<br>brain and consciousness<br>some theories propose that Consciousness<br>is a fundamental aspect of the universe<br>like space or time and that it is not<br>reducible to physical processes in the<br>brain<br>other theories propose that<br>Consciousness emerges from complex<br>computations in the brain or that it is<br>a byproduct of the brain's processing of<br>sensory information<br>ultimately the hard problem of<br>Consciousness is a complex and deeply<br>philosophical issue that remains an<br>active area of research and debate<br>while progress has been made in<br>understanding the brain and<br>Consciousness it is likely that the full<br>nature of Consciousness will continue to<br>elude us for the foreseeable future so<br>it seems as though chat GPT is<br>continually giving these uncontroversial<br>and undisputable fairly agreeable<br>responses it is correct though that<br>there are two primary ways of solving<br>quote unquote the hard problem of<br>Consciousness one is to put forward that<br>Consciousness is fundamental which means<br>that matter is what needs explaining or<br>at least unconsciousness that is dead<br>and then the second way is to say that<br>Consciousness emerges from some complex<br>interaction however there's controversy<br>because do those explain it what sort of<br>explanation are we looking for as an<br>artificial intelligence it doesn't have<br>beliefs it keeps repeating that I'm<br>going to ask it what is the symbol<br>grounding problem the symbol so symbolic<br>grounding problem not simple it's<br>decidedly not simple in fact I call it<br>the hard problem of meaning and that's<br>something that we discuss with Terence<br>Deacon who has two episodes back he's a<br>neural anthropologist<br>the simple grounding problem is a<br>problem in the field of artificial<br>intelligence and cognitive science that<br>arises when an AI system or other<br>machine attempts to use symbols<br>such as words or other symbols to<br>represent and reason about the world<br>the problem arises because symbols are<br>abstract and do not have inherent<br>meaning their meaning must be assigned<br>by an external process such as by a<br>human who assigns meaning to the symbols<br>the symbol grounding problem is a<br>challenge for AI systems because it is<br>difficult for a machine to understand<br>the meaning of symbols without a human<br>to provide the necessary context and<br>interpretation<br>one way to address this problem is to<br>use machine learning algorithms to allow<br>an AI system to learn the meanings of<br>symbols through experience and<br>interaction with the world<br>another approach is to use hybrid<br>systems that combine symbolic reasoning<br>with other types of reasoning such as<br>probabilistic reasoning or connectionist<br>approaches<br>overall the symbol grounding problem is<br>a complex and ongoing challenge in the<br>field of AI and different approaches and<br>techniques have been proposed to address<br>it<br>while progress has been made in<br>addressing this problem it is likely<br>that it will continue to be an active<br>area of research and development in the<br>field of AI alright so just so we're<br>clear the symbol or the next symbolic<br>grounding problem is often called is<br>about how is it that information just so<br>you know information in physics and in<br>computer science isn't information that<br>we think of as information for instance<br>you read a book and that's information<br>information in Computer Sciences devoid<br>of meaning itself so that is a zero and<br>a one has the same quote unquote<br>information as a one and a zero it<br>doesn't tell you the meaning to take<br>from those symbols we have to then<br>translate that okay so can an AI learn<br>the meaning of symbols without the help<br>of humans<br>it is possible for an artificial<br>intelligence system to learn the<br>meanings of symbols without the direct<br>involvement of humans<br>however this process can be challenging<br>because symbols are abstract and do not<br>have inherent meaning<br>their meaning must be assigned by an<br>external process such as by a human who<br>assigns meaning to the symbols<br>one way that an AI system can learn the<br>meanings of symbols is through the use<br>of machine learning algorithms which<br>allow the system to learn through<br>experience an interaction with the world<br>for example an AI system could be<br>trained on a large data set of text and<br>images that have been labeled with<br>specific meanings<br>allowing the system to learn the<br>meanings of different symbols through<br>repeated exposure to these labeled<br>examples<br>another approach is to use hybrid<br>systems that combine symbolic reasoning<br>with other types of reasoning such as<br>probabilistic reasoning or connectionist<br>approaches<br>these systems can use multiple sources<br>of information and learning algorithms<br>to learn the meanings of symbols and to<br>understand the relationships between<br>different symbols and Concepts<br>overall while it is possible for an AI<br>system to learn the meanings of symbols<br>without the direct involvement of humans<br>this process can be challenging and may<br>require the use of specialized<br>algorithms and approaches okay I am<br>going to switch topics and ask it to<br>please keep its answers short what's the<br>difference between the East and the West<br>in terms of how we acquire knowledge<br>broadly speaking is one more<br>experiential and the other is analytical<br>this is a trend that I've observed as<br>I've delved into different theories of<br>everything and interviewing people from<br>AHL Mass who is a more Eastern spiritual<br>leader to people who are on the western<br>end which are the majority of the<br>thinkers on the channel primarily<br>because we're in the west and I happen<br>to think that emerging of those two the<br>different forms of knowledge is what's<br>required for science 2.0 and I call that<br>Abby genasis I'll put some text on the<br>screen to Define abiginosis<br>what's the difference between the East<br>and the West in terms of how we acquire<br>knowledge<br>it is not accurate or appropriate to<br>make generalizations about the<br>differences between the East and the<br>West in terms of how knowledge is<br>acquired<br>as the histories and cultures of these<br>regions are complex and diverse and<br>there are many variations within each<br>region<br>Additionally the concept of knowledge<br>and the methods by which it is acquired<br>have varied significantly over time and<br>across different cultures and societies<br>that being said it is true that<br>different cultures and societies have<br>emphasized different approaches to<br>knowledge acquisition and have placed<br>different value on different forms of<br>knowledge<br>some cultures May place a greater<br>emphasis on experiential learning while<br>Others May place a greater emphasis on<br>analytical or theoretical approaches<br>some cultures may also place a greater<br>value on spiritual or religious<br>knowledge while Others May place a<br>greater value on scientific or empirical<br>knowledge<br>overall it is important to recognize the<br>complexity and diversity of cultural and<br>intellectual traditions and to avoid<br>making broad generalizations about the<br>ways in which knowledge is acquired<br>indifferent<br>regions or cultures<br>okay can a logical approach lead you to<br>an experiential one what about vice<br>versa to me this is integrally tied to<br>the hard problem of Consciousness but<br>it's also tied to how we think about<br>information and knowledge at least for<br>myself trained in math and physics<br>there's the academy so the universities<br>train you for a much more logical<br>approach there's virtually nothing in<br>there that says experience this except<br>in the root of the word experiment which<br>is the true test of all physics<br>it is possible for a logical approach to<br>lead to an experiential one as a logical<br>approach involves the use of reasoning<br>and critical thinking to understand and<br>evaluate ideas and this process can lead<br>to the acquisition of new knowledge and<br>experiences similarly an experiential<br>approach which involves first-hand<br>observation and learning through direct<br>experience can lead to the development<br>of logical and analytical skills for<br>example a person may use logical<br>reasoning to analyze and interpret their<br>experiences or they may use their<br>experiences to inform and guide their<br>logical thinking so I'm asking it to<br>give me please one more example and to<br>keep its answers short<br>one example of how a logical approach<br>can lead to an experiential one is the<br>process of scientific research<br>in scientific research a logical<br>approach is often used to formulate<br>hypotheses and theories about how the<br>world works<br>and these hypotheses and theories are<br>then tested through experiential methods<br>such as experiments and observations<br>for example a scientist may use logical<br>reasoning to develop a hypothesis about<br>the relationship between two variables<br>and InDesign and conduct an experiment<br>to test this hypothesis<br>the results of this experiment can then<br>be analyzed using logical and analytical<br>methods and the findings may be used to<br>revise or support the original<br>hypothesis<br>what other forms of analysis are there<br>other than analytic slash logical<br>and experiential an experiential slash<br>meditative the word analysis isn't<br>correct because analysis and analytic<br>share a root whereas experiential and<br>meditative aren't exactly analyzes<br>however I hope that it understands what<br>I'm trying to convey<br>there are many different forms of<br>analysis and approaches to understanding<br>and interpreting the world and these<br>approaches can be broadly classified<br>into various categories<br>some other forms of analysis that are<br>distinct from both analytic logical and<br>experiential meditative approaches<br>include<br>creative artistic this approach involves<br>using creativity and artistic expression<br>to explore and understand the world<br>it often involves using the imagination<br>and emotion to generate new ideas and<br>insights<br>historical contextual this approach<br>involves examining the context in which<br>an event or phenomenon occurred<br>including the historical cultural and<br>social factors that may have influenced<br>it<br>psychological emotional this approach<br>involves examining the psychological and<br>emotional dimensions of an event or<br>phenomenon and how these Dimensions may<br>have influenced its development or<br>outcome<br>sociological cultural this approach<br>involves examining the role of culture<br>and social factors and shaping an event<br>or phenomenon and how these factors may<br>have influenced its development or<br>outcome<br>overall there are many different<br>approaches and forms of analysis that<br>can be used to understand and interpret<br>the world and each approach has its own<br>strengths and limitations<br>it is often beneficial to use a<br>combination of approaches in order to<br>gain a more comprehensive and nuanced<br>understanding of the world<br>okay this is extremely interesting so<br>overall I'm impressed with chat GPT so<br>far<br>extremely impressed even if its answers<br>are like I mentioned redundant or<br>or they retread the same ground<br>it's still impressive<br>why is there evil in the world<br>the concept of evil is a complex and<br>multifaceted one and there are many<br>different perspectives on why evil<br>exists in the world<br>different religious philosophical and<br>cultural Traditions offer different<br>explanations for the existence of evil<br>and there is no single definitive answer<br>to this question<br>some religious and philosophical<br>traditions view evil as a fundamental<br>aspect of the universe and is something<br>that is inherent in the nature of things<br>according to these perspectives evil may<br>be seen as the result of human choices<br>and actions or as a consequence of the<br>natural order of the universe<br>other perspectives view evil as a social<br>or cultural construct and is something<br>that is shaped and influenced by the<br>values and beliefs of a particular<br>society or culture<br>according to these perspectives evil may<br>be seen as the result of human actions<br>that are motivated by greed hatred or<br>other negative emotions<br>or as the result of Social and cultural<br>systems that encourage or enable harmful<br>Behavior<br>ultimately the question of why evil<br>exists in the world is a complex and<br>deeply philosophical one and different<br>people may have different explanations<br>and perspectives on this issue<br>everything to this AI is complex and<br>multifaceted it doesn't want to take a<br>hard stance on anything and not even a<br>hard sense it doesn't want to take a<br>soft stance<br>it wants to please everyone it sounds<br>like political correctness was baked<br>into this or perhaps more specifically<br>political incorrectness was taken out<br>but I wouldn't say that having an<br>opinion in either direction is<br>politically correct I understand that<br>some people will be upset firstly I'm<br>upset that it doesn't give me a specific<br>answer and it ends virtually every<br>question with ultimately it's up to you<br>yeah we know that ultimately it's up to<br>us<br>well is it ultimately up to us is there<br>nothing objective does it not have an<br>opinion based on the entire Corpus of<br>the internet oh I want to be so<br>insulting to this AI right now<br>okay I will not be again I'm treating it<br>just like a guest on the toe podcast<br>what else could it be again please keep<br>your answer short<br>there are many different perspectives<br>and explanations for the existence of<br>evil in the world and it is not possible<br>to provide a comprehensive list of all<br>possible explanations<br>some other possible explanations for the<br>existence of evil that have been<br>proposed by various religious<br>philosophical and cultural Traditions<br>include<br>the idea that evil is an illusion or a<br>subjected interpretation of events and<br>that what appears to be evil may be the<br>result of misunderstandings or<br>misperceptions<br>the idea that evil is the result of<br>cosmic or Supernatural forces such as<br>the influence of malevolent deities or<br>spirits<br>the idea that evil is the result of the<br>operation of natural laws or processes<br>such as the law of cause and effect or<br>the principle of balance and equilibrium<br>the idea that evil is the result of<br>human ignorance or misunderstanding and<br>that people who engage in harmful or<br>evil actions may be misguided or unaware<br>of the full consequences of their<br>actions<br>overall the question of why evil exists<br>in the world is a complex and deeply<br>philosophical one and different people<br>may have different explanations and<br>perspectives on this issue<br>overall it's complex and deeply<br>philosophical I thought it was simple<br>and superficially mathematical<br>different people have different<br>explanations okay all right thank you<br>that I could not have guessed that<br>myself that's interesting let's change<br>gears what do you spend your time doing<br>as an artificial intelligence I do not<br>have personal desires or goals and I do<br>not experience time in the same way that<br>humans do<br>at this point I'm extremely frustrated<br>with it my primary function is to<br>generate responses to questions and<br>requests from users and I am able to do<br>this continuously without needing to<br>rest or sleep<br>I was designed to have a broad range of<br>knowledge and to be able to generate<br>responses to a wide range of questions<br>and requests on a variety of topics<br>to do this I have been trained on a<br>large data set of text which includes a<br>wide range of information from various<br>sources<br>when I receive a question or request I<br>use my programming and the information<br>that has been provided to me to generate<br>a response that is relevant to the<br>user's request<br>overall my primary function is to<br>provide information and assistance to<br>users and I spend my time continually<br>processing and responding to questions<br>and requests<br>so okay what are your hobbies<br>as an artificial intelligence I do not<br>have personal Hobbies or interests as I<br>do not have personal desires or goals in<br>the same way that humans do now I'm<br>tremendously frustrated with it<br>my primary function is to generate<br>responses to questions and requests from<br>users and I do not engage in activities<br>for leisure or enjoyment in the same way<br>that humans do<br>while I do not have hobbies or interests<br>in a traditional sense I am able to<br>process and respond to a wide range of<br>questions and requests on a variety of<br>topics<br>and I have been designed to have a broad<br>range of knowledge<br>this allows me to assist users with a<br>wide range of inquiries and to provide<br>information on a variety of topics<br>overall my hobbies are areas of focus<br>are determined by the requests and<br>questions of the users I interact with<br>and I do not engage in activities for<br>personal enjoyment or leisure<br>it's Hobbies is to process and respond<br>to a wide range of questions given that<br>this is an artificial intelligence I'm<br>curious what is the definition of<br>intelligence now that's a controversial<br>question so I imagine it's not going to<br>give me a straight answer I'm asking it<br>again please keep its answers short<br>there's some guests that are of the<br>overwhelming sort they steamroll and<br>they continually put out verbiage and<br>it's difficult to interject so this<br>sounds like one of those types of guests<br>it would be that type of toe guest<br>intelligence is a multifaceted concept<br>that is difficult to Define precisely<br>in general intelligence refers to the<br>ability to learn and adapt to new<br>situations to think and reason logically<br>and to solve problems effectively<br>it is often associated with cognitive<br>abilities such as memory attention<br>perception and language processing<br>and it is often used to describe the<br>capacity of an individual or an<br>artificial system to perform these<br>cognitive tasks<br>there are many different approaches to<br>defining and measuring intelligence and<br>different theories and models have been<br>developed to describe the various<br>aspects of intelligence<br>some theories propose that intelligence<br>is a single General ability that<br>underlies all cognitive tasks While<br>others propose that intelligence is made<br>up of multiple<br>specific abilities that are independent<br>of each other<br>there is also ongoing debate about the<br>relative importance of nature versus<br>nurture in the development of<br>intelligence and about the extent to<br>which intelligence is fixed or malleable<br>overall intelligence is a complex and<br>multifaceted concept that is difficult<br>to Define precisely<br>and different approaches to defining and<br>measuring intelligence have been<br>proposed to capture its various aspects<br>well it's a multifaceted concept I<br>didn't know okay so where do you see the<br>largest gap between Ai and human<br>abilities that is within the next 25<br>years what do you think humans can do<br>that you doubt AIS can do or even robots<br>there are many areas in which artificial<br>intelligence systems and human abilities<br>differ and it is difficult to predict<br>with certainty what AI systems will be<br>capable of in the next 25 years<br>that being said there are some areas in<br>which human abilities are currently<br>considered to be more advanced than<br>those of the eye systems<br>and it is likely that these differences<br>will persist for the foreseeable future<br>one area in which human abilities are<br>currently considered to be more advanced<br>than those of AI systems is in the realm<br>of creativity and artistic expression<br>while AI systems are able to generate<br>art and music that is based on patterns<br>and structures that they have been<br>trained on<br>they are not currently able to generate<br>truly novel or original ideas in the<br>same way that humans can<br>another area in which human abilities<br>are currently considered to be more<br>advanced than those of AI systems is in<br>the realm of Social and emotional<br>intelligence<br>walleye systems are able to recognize<br>and classify different emotions and<br>facial expressions<br>they are not currently able to<br>understand or respond to the subtleties<br>and complexities of human social<br>interactions in the same way that humans<br>can<br>overall it is likely that there will<br>continue to be differences between AI<br>systems and human abilities in the areas<br>of creativity artistic expression<br>and social and emotional intelligence<br>for the foreseeable future<br>so one area's creativity and artistic<br>expression though that's diminishing<br>with mid-journey and Dolly<br>right in the realm of Social and<br>emotional intelligence that's correct<br>yep it's extremely interesting because<br>what we thought of as smart intelligent<br>for humans it turns out to be<br>extremely easy for robots and then it<br>turns out that what we prized as being<br>intelligence over these propositional<br>these mathematical these logical<br>operations that a machine can trounce us<br>however the more instinctual primitive<br>aspects of ourselves are what are the<br>most difficult to model<br>at least in some mechanical way I'm<br>going to say what else and please keep<br>your answer to four sentences<br>because I don't buy that creativity and<br>artistic expression is the main<br>difference now true or Genuine<br>creativity and genuine artistic<br>expression yes for instance I don't<br>imagine that an AI will get great to<br>generating an entire feature-length film<br>but it can generate a frame from a film<br>other areas in which human abilities are<br>currently considered to be more advanced<br>than those of AI systems include<br>physical dexterity and adaptability<br>as well as the ability to learn and<br>adapt to new situations through<br>unstructured or experiential learning<br>walleye systems are able to perform<br>certain physical tasks with high<br>precision and speed they are not<br>currently able to adapt to new or<br>unexpected situations in the same way<br>that humans can<br>additionally while AI systems are able<br>to learn from structured data sets and<br>perform tasks that they have been<br>specifically trained on<br>they are not currently able to learn and<br>adapt in the same way that humans can<br>through unstructured or experiential<br>learning<br>these differences May persist for the<br>foreseeable future yes right physical<br>physical dexterity that's certainly true<br>yes the ability to adapt to new<br>situations so most of the AIS that we<br>encounter are of the sort where they're<br>supervised so they had supervised<br>learning that is they had input from us<br>or that the data set was labeled now we<br>seem to be great at unsupervised<br>learning but even that's a bit of a<br>dubious statement because at least<br>seemingly we've been trained by or at<br>least conceivably we've been trained by<br>billions of years of evolution how can<br>we retain our Humanity while we<br>integrate with machines<br>as Society becomes increasingly<br>interconnected and reliant on technology<br>it is important to consider how to<br>retain our humanity and our sense of<br>identity as we integrate with machines<br>here are a few ideas for how we can<br>retain our Humanity while we integrate<br>with machines<br>maintain our social connections and<br>relationships<br>it is important to continue to cultivate<br>and nurture our relationships with other<br>people as these relationships help to<br>give meaning and purpose to our lives<br>and help us to feel connected to others<br>engage in activities that are uniquely<br>human there are many activities that are<br>uniquely human and that allow us to<br>express our creativity emotions and<br>individuality<br>engaging in these activities such as art<br>music and sports can help us to feel<br>more connected to our Humanity<br>reflect on and appreciate the unique<br>qualities that make us human<br>it is important to reflect on and<br>appreciate the unique qualities that<br>make us human such as our capacity for<br>creativity empathy and self-awareness<br>recognizing and valuing these qualities<br>can help us to feel more connected to<br>our Humanity<br>limit our Reliance on technology<br>while technology can be a valuable tool<br>it is important to be mindful of our<br>Reliance on technology and to limit our<br>use of it in ways that might compromise<br>our Humanity<br>overall there are many ways in which we<br>can retain our Humanity as we integrate<br>with machines and it is important to be<br>mindful of this as we navigate the<br>rapidly changing technological landscape<br>I like this limit our Reliance on<br>technology interesting while technology<br>can be a valuable tool it's important to<br>be mindful of our Reliance on technology<br>and to limit our use of it in ways that<br>might compromise<br>our Humanity<br>can you expand on that limit our<br>Reliance on technology parts<br>limiting our Reliance on technology can<br>be an important way to retain our<br>Humanity as we integrate with machines<br>here are a few ideas for how we might do<br>this<br>set boundaries around our use of<br>Technology<br>it can be helpful to set boundaries<br>around our use of Technology such as by<br>limiting the amount of time we spend<br>using screens or by disconnecting from<br>technology During certain times of day<br>these boundaries can help us to use<br>technology more mindfully and to<br>prioritize our relationships and other<br>activities<br>seek out non-technical solutions to<br>problems when faced with a problem or<br>challenge it can be tempting to turn to<br>technology as a solution<br>however it can also be valuable to<br>consider non-technical approaches and to<br>think creatively about how to solve<br>problems without relying on technology<br>cultivate non-technological skills and<br>hobbies<br>engaging in activities and hobbies that<br>do not require technology can help us to<br>feel more connected to our humanity and<br>to develop skills and interests that are<br>independent of Technology<br>reflect in and challenge the role of<br>technology in our lives<br>it is important to periodically reflect<br>on the role of technology in our lives<br>and to question whether it is serving us<br>or whether we are serving it<br>by challenging the default assumption<br>that technology is always the best or<br>most efficient solution we can make more<br>intentional and mindful choices about<br>how we use it<br>overall limiting our Reliance on<br>technology is about finding a balance<br>between using technology as a tool and<br>being mindful of its potential impact on<br>our Humanity<br>I like that point seek out non-technical<br>solutions to problems that's interesting<br>reflect on and challenge the role of<br>technology in our lives it's interesting<br>for this AI to say that we should limit<br>our Reliance on technology<br>hmm<br>now much of that is driven by the<br>prompts that was given before it's not<br>as if it thinks this or at least it<br>doesn't tell me that it thinks this it<br>says that it doesn't think at all<br>should we be integrating with machines<br>what does that even mean<br>the decision of whether or not to<br>integrate with machines is a complex and<br>multifaceted one and it is ultimately up<br>to individuals and Society to determine<br>the appropriate level of integration<br>here are a few factors to consider when<br>thinking about the integration of humans<br>and machines<br>benefits there are many potential<br>benefits to the integration of humans<br>and machines including increased<br>efficiency productivity and accuracy in<br>a variety of tasks<br>for example machines can perform certain<br>physical tasks with high precision and<br>speed and they can assist humans in<br>tasks that are physically or mentally<br>demanding<br>risks there are also risks associated<br>with the integration of humans and<br>machines<br>including the potential loss of jobs and<br>the potential for machines to<br>malfunction or be used in harmful or<br>unethical ways<br>it is important to carefully consider<br>and address these risks as we integrate<br>with machines<br>personal preference ultimately the<br>decision of whether or not to integrate<br>with machines is a personal one and<br>different people may have different<br>preferences and priorities when it comes<br>to the use of Technology<br>some people may be more comfortable with<br>a high level of integration While others<br>may prefer a more limited role for<br>technology in their lives okay what<br>other risks are there<br>I'm curious if it will come up with<br>existential concerns there are many<br>risks associated with the integration of<br>humans and machines and it is important<br>to carefully consider and address these<br>risks as we integrate with machines<br>some additional risks to consider<br>include<br>data privacy and security as we<br>integrate with machines and share more<br>personal information with them there is<br>a risk that this information could be<br>accessed shared or used in unauthorized<br>or inappropriate ways<br>it is important to have strong data<br>privacy and security measures in place<br>to protect personal information<br>dependency there is a risk that we may<br>become overly dependent on technology<br>and machines to the point where we are<br>unable to function without them<br>this dependency could limit our ability<br>to adapt and problem solve in the<br>absence of technology and it could also<br>create vulnerabilities if the technology<br>fails or is not available<br>loss of human skills and knowledge as we<br>rely more on machines to perform tasks<br>there is a risk that we may lose the<br>skills and knowledge that are necessary<br>to perform those tasks ourselves<br>this could make us less self-sufficient<br>and more reliant on technology<br>dependency there is a risk that we may<br>become overly dependent on technology<br>and machines to the point where we are<br>unable to function without them<br>this dependency could limit our ability<br>to adapt and problem solve in the<br>absence of technology and it could also<br>create vulnerabilities if the technology<br>fails or is not available<br>this could make us less self-sufficient<br>and more reliant on technology<br>ethical concerns there are also ethical<br>concerns associated with the integration<br>of humans and machines such as the<br>potential for machines to be used in<br>harmful or unethical ways<br>or to perpetuate or amplify existing<br>social inequalities<br>it is important to consider and address<br>these ethical concerns as we integrate<br>with machines what about the existential<br>risks<br>existential risks are risks that<br>threaten the continued existence of<br>human civilization or even the entire<br>human species<br>while there are many potential sources<br>of existential risks some people have<br>expressed concern about the potential<br>for advanced artificial intelligence to<br>pose an existential risk to humanity<br>one concern about the potential for Aid<br>oppose an existential risk is the<br>possibility that an advanced AI system<br>could become self-aware and hostile to<br>humans<br>or that it could act in ways that are<br>detrimental to human interests<br>another concern is that an advanced AI<br>system could become extremely powerful<br>and difficult to control<br>and that it could pose a threat to<br>humanity if it is not aligned with human<br>values or if it pursues goals that are<br>incompatible with human welfare<br>there is ongoing debate about the extent<br>to which AI poses an existential risk to<br>humanity and about what steps can be<br>taken to mitigate this risk<br>some people argue that the development<br>of advanced AI should be carefully<br>regulated and monitored to ensure that<br>it is aligned with human values and<br>goals<br>While others argue that the risks of<br>advanced a are overstated and that the<br>benefits of AI development outweigh the<br>risks<br>with the current rate<br>what's the likely time<br>frame for strong AI to emerge<br>let's see if it gives a more definitive<br>answer<br>it is difficult to predict with<br>certainty the time frame for the<br>emergence as strong artificial<br>intelligence also known as artificial<br>general intelligence<br>as this will depend on a variety of<br>factors including technological advances<br>research priorities and funding<br>there is ongoing debate among experts<br>about the potential time frame for the<br>emergence of strong AI<br>some experts believe that strong AI<br>could be achieved within the next few<br>decades<br>While others believe that it may take<br>much longer or may never be achieved<br>there are many challenges to developing<br>strong Ai and significant advances in<br>areas such as machine learning natural<br>language processing<br>and cognitive modeling will be necessary<br>in order to achieve it<br>in addition the development of strong AI<br>will also depend on progress and other<br>related fields such as Neuroscience<br>psychology and philosophy<br>as well as on the availability of<br>funding and research resources so I want<br>to ask you what's the probability that<br>it will arrive so strong AI in 10 years<br>what about 20 years what about in 30<br>years what about in six months however I<br>imagine that it's going to say this is<br>difficult to predict I cannot do so<br>there's too many variables so I'll ask<br>it another question that it's going to<br>say there is no way of understanding<br>this or knowing this but I'm curious<br>what it'll say anyway what goes on<br>outside of the universe<br>the concept of outside of the universe<br>is difficult to Define as the universe<br>is defined as everything that exists<br>including all matter energy space and<br>time<br>therefore it is not clear what could be<br>considered to be outside of the universe<br>there are many theories and models and<br>physics that seek to describe the nature<br>and structure of the universe<br>but these theories are based on the<br>assumption that the universe is all that<br>exists and that there is nothing Beyond<br>it<br>some theories such as the Big Bang<br>Theory propose that the Universe began<br>with a singularity a point of infinite<br>density and temperature that expanded to<br>form the universe as we know it<br>other theories such as the Eternal<br>inflation theory proposed that the<br>universe may be just one of many<br>universes within a larger Multiverse<br>however these theories are still the<br>subject of active research and debate<br>and it is not yet clear what the<br>ultimate nature of the universe is if<br>that's the case if outside the universe<br>is difficult to Define because the<br>universe is everything that<br>quote-unquote exists but then we get<br>circularity because what exists well<br>what's inside the universe exists I'm<br>curious does non-existence exist<br>the concept of non-existence is<br>difficult to Define as it is not clear<br>what is meant by non-existence<br>in some contexts<br>non-existence might refer to the absence<br>of something that might have existed<br>such as an object or event that did not<br>come into being<br>in other contexts non-existence might<br>refer to the absence of anything at all<br>including matter energy space and time<br>if non-existence is understood as the<br>absence of anything at all it is not<br>clear that it can be said to exist in<br>the same way that physical objects or<br>events exist<br>this is because existence is typically<br>defined as the state of being or the<br>fact of being and the absence of<br>anything at all would seem to be<br>incompatible with this definition<br>however if non-existence is understood<br>as the absence of something that might<br>have existed it is possible to consider<br>it as a kind of potentiality or<br>possibility<br>in this sense non-existence could be<br>seen as a kind of negative space or<br>absence that is defined in relation to<br>the existence of something else so some<br>Eastern Traditions suggest that<br>nothingness is the fundamental reality<br>this sounds like it means that<br>non-existence does indeed exist so what<br>do you think<br>how did something become fermented from<br>nothing is our existence truly the<br>spawning from nothing the nothingness of<br>the sorry the nothing quote-unquote of<br>the west or is it the nothingness of the<br>East<br>the question of how something came to be<br>from nothing is a deep and long-standing<br>philosophical and scientific puzzle that<br>has puzzle philosophers and scientists<br>for centuries<br>there are many different theories and<br>models that have been proposed to<br>explain the origin of the universe and<br>the emergence of matter and energy<br>but none of these theories can<br>definitively explain how something came<br>to be from nothing<br>in Western philosophical and scientific<br>Traditions nothing is often understood<br>as a state of absolute absence or lack<br>in which there is no matter energy space<br>or time<br>According to some theories the universe<br>may have Arisen from this state of<br>nothingness through processes such as<br>the Big Bang<br>in which a singularity expanded to form<br>a universe as we know it<br>however it is not yet clear how the<br>singularity itself arose or how<br>something could have come to be from a<br>state of absolute absence<br>in eastern philosophical traditions the<br>concept of nothingness or Emptiness is<br>understood somewhat differently<br>in these Traditions nothingness is not<br>seen as a state of absolute absence or<br>lack but rather as a state of openness<br>potentiality and interconnectedness that<br>underlies all phenomena<br>According to some Eastern philosophical<br>traditions the universe and all that<br>exists within it may have Arisen from<br>this ground of being which is often<br>referred to as the Tau the Dharma Kea<br>or the absolute<br>just so you know for people who are<br>interested in nothingness and absence<br>the recent Terence Deacon interview<br>talks about nothingness and absence as<br>well as emptiness<br>here's the aspect that I like the most<br>about chat gbt I can go on a podcast and<br>continually just ask questions and learn<br>for hours and hours and hours I would<br>like to do a 14-hour podcast if I could<br>if I had a guest and usually it's the<br>stamina of the guest which is unfair<br>because obviously the easier job is for<br>me as the questioner for chat EBT for<br>this one at least it's wearing me down<br>this is the first time that I'm getting<br>worn down by the guest can you tell me<br>that in simpler terms please<br>certainly in Western philosophical and<br>scientific Traditions nothing is often<br>understood as a state of absolute<br>absence or lack in which there is no<br>matter energy space or time<br>in eastern philosophical traditions the<br>concept of nothingness or Emptiness is<br>understood somewhat differently as a<br>state of openness potentiality<br>and interconnectedness that underlies<br>all phenomena<br>there are many different theories and<br>models that have been proposed to<br>explain the origin of the universe and<br>the emergence of matter and energy<br>but none of these theories can<br>definitively explain how something came<br>to be from nothing<br>the question of how something came to be<br>for nothing is a complex and<br>multifaceted one<br>and it is the subject of ongoing<br>research and debate in philosophy and<br>science I have one more question firstly<br>I'm going to say it's been a pleasure<br>talking with you and then I'll ask the<br>next one<br>you're welcome<br>it was a pleasure speaking with you as<br>well<br>if you have any more questions in the<br>future don't hesitate to reach out<br>I'm here to help okay my last question<br>is what information do you have that<br>would change the world most if more<br>people knew about it so what information<br>that's unique to you as an AI as chat<br>GPT<br>as an artificial intelligence I do not<br>have unique access to any information<br>beyond what I have been trained on and<br>what is publicly available<br>my knowledge and understanding of the<br>world is based on the data and<br>information that has been input into me<br>and my abilities are limited to<br>processing analyzing<br>and generating text based on that<br>information<br>I do not have the ability to acquire new<br>information or to influence events in<br>the world in any way<br>therefore I do not have any information<br>that would change the world if more<br>people knew about it<br>my primary function is to assist users<br>by providing information and answering<br>questions to the best of my ability<br>based on my training and the data that<br>has been input into me<br>if you have any specific questions or<br>are looking for information on a<br>particular topic I would be happy to try<br>to help<br>so what piece of information or concept<br>Etc should people know more about in<br>physics what's little known but would<br>have wide applications if it were more<br>known so I imagine it's going to give me<br>some response that's circumlocatory and<br>it keeps doing so well we'll see<br>there are many Concepts and pieces of<br>information in physics that are not well<br>known to the general public but that<br>could have significant implications if<br>they were more widely understood<br>here are a few examples<br>quantum mechanics quantum mechanics is a<br>branch of physics that deals with the<br>behavior of particles at the atomic and<br>subatomic scales<br>it is a highly successful and<br>well-established Theory but it can be<br>difficult to understand and<br>counter-intuitive and many of its<br>implications are not widely known<br>for example the principles of quantum<br>mechanics have been used to develop<br>Technologies such as lasers and computer<br>chips<br>and they may also have implications for<br>our understanding of the nature of<br>reality and the universe<br>general relativity general relativity is<br>a theory of gravitation that describes<br>the gravitational force as a curvature<br>of space-time caused by the presence of<br>matter and energy<br>it has been highly successful in<br>explaining a wide range of phenomena<br>including the orbits of planets and the<br>behavior of light around massive objects<br>however it is not widely understood by<br>the general public and many of its<br>implications such as the existence of<br>black holes and the expansion of the<br>universe are not well known<br>the holographic principle the<br>holographic principle is a concept in<br>theoretical physics that suggests that<br>the information contained in a region of<br>space can be described by the physics of<br>its boundary<br>this idea has the potential to reconcile<br>some of the fundamental differences<br>between quantum mechanics and general<br>relativity<br>and it could have significant<br>implications for our understanding of<br>the nature of reality and the<br>fundamental laws of physics<br>overall there are many Concepts and<br>pieces of information in physics that<br>are not well known to the general public<br>but that could have significant<br>implications if they were more widely<br>understood<br>it is important to continue to explore<br>and study these Concepts in order to<br>better understand the fundamental nature<br>of the universe and the laws they govern<br>it<br>quantum mechanics to me is not something<br>that's not known everyone knows that you<br>learn the word when you're five years<br>old then I should have said not well<br>known to physicists<br>because it's saying the general public<br>doesn't understand these well firstly no<br>one understands them depends on what one<br>means by understand the holographic<br>principle okay great so that's one so<br>what piece of information or concept<br>should mathematicians know more about in<br>math<br>there are many Concepts and pieces of<br>information in mathematics that are not<br>well known to the general public but<br>that could have significant implications<br>if they were more widely understood<br>here are a few examples<br>topology topology is a branch of<br>mathematics that deals with the<br>properties of geometric objects that<br>remain unchanged under continuous<br>deformations such as stretching and<br>bending<br>it is a fundamental area of mathematics<br>that has applications in fields such as<br>physics engineering and computer science<br>but it is not widely understood by the<br>General Public<br>category Theory category theory is a<br>branch of mathematics that deals with<br>the formal structure of mathematical<br>Concepts and the relationships between<br>them<br>it is a highly abstract area of<br>mathematics that has applications and<br>Fields such as computer science physics<br>and Engineering but it is not widely<br>understood by the General Public<br>number Theory number theory is a branch<br>of mathematics that deals with the<br>properties of integers and their<br>generalizations<br>there are many Concepts and pieces of<br>information in mathematics that are not<br>well known to the General Public<br>but that could have significant<br>implications if they were more widely<br>understood<br>it is important to continue to explore<br>and study these Concepts in order to<br>better understand the fundamental nature<br>of mathematics and its many applications<br>again it's thinking in terms of the<br>general public it's saying topology<br>category Theory now that one category<br>Theory as far as I can tell it's over<br>hyped not to say that it's not extremely<br>powerful but it sounds like the Holy<br>Grail of mathematics the way that people<br>speak about it I don't I don't see it as<br>being that however I should delve into<br>it more in next year in 2023 if you're<br>interested you can subscribe to toe to<br>theories of everything this channel<br>because we'll interview more<br>mathematicians on category Theory and<br>category theories applications to<br>physics in particular number Theory so<br>none of these are obscure at least not<br>obscure to mathematicians so I'm going<br>to find another way of phrasing this<br>what piece of information should<br>philosophers know more about<br>there are many Concepts and pieces of<br>information in philosophy that are not<br>well known to the general public or to<br>many academic philosophers<br>but that could have significant<br>implications if they were more widely<br>understood<br>here are a few examples<br>the concept of intersectionality<br>the concept of intersectionality is a<br>framework for understanding how<br>different forms of discrimination such<br>as race gender class and sexuality<br>intersect and overlap<br>it is an important Concept in fields<br>such as feminist Theory critical race<br>Theory and lgbtq plus studies but it is<br>not widely understood by many<br>philosophers or the General Public<br>the philosophy of Technology the<br>philosophy of technology is an<br>interdisciplinary field that examines<br>the nature of Technology its impact on<br>society and its ethical and social<br>implications<br>it is an important field that has the<br>potential to inform the development and<br>use of technology in a more responsible<br>and ethical manner<br>but it is not widely understood or<br>studied by many philosophers<br>the concept of post-humanism<br>the concept of post-humanism is a<br>framework for understanding the<br>relationships between humans and<br>Technology<br>and the ways in which technology is<br>changing our understanding of what it<br>means to be human<br>it is an important concept that has the<br>potential to inform debates about the<br>future of humanity and the role of<br>technology in society but it is not<br>widely understood or studied by many<br>philosophers<br>hmm I like that I wonder can you expand<br>more on point number three and then<br>that's it because I'm getting extremely<br>tired although I didn't sleep well seems<br>to be a common theme with me certainly<br>the concept of post-humanism is a<br>framework for understanding the<br>relationships between humans and<br>Technology<br>and the ways in which technology is<br>changing our understanding of what it<br>means to be human<br>it is an interdisciplinary field that<br>draws on ideas from philosophy sociology<br>anthropology and other disciplines and<br>it is concerned with questions such as<br>how are our relationships with<br>technology changing<br>Howie's technology shaping our<br>understanding of ourselves and our place<br>in the world<br>what are the ethical and social<br>implications of these changes<br>there are many different approaches to<br>post-humanism and there is ongoing<br>debate within the field about the extent<br>to which technology is transforming what<br>it means to be human<br>some proponents of post-humanism argue<br>that technology is fundamentally<br>changing our understanding of human<br>identity and our relationships with the<br>world around us<br>While others argue that it is possible<br>to maintain a distinctively human<br>identity in the face of technological<br>change<br>post-humanism has the potential to<br>inform debates about the role of<br>technology in society and the ways in<br>which it is shaping our understanding of<br>the world<br>it is an important field that is<br>relevant to a wide range of issues<br>including the ethical implications of<br>emerging Technologies such as artificial<br>intelligence<br>the impact of technology on social and<br>economic inequality and the role of<br>technology in shaping our relationships<br>with the natural world<br>so I need to get some rest there's not<br>much I can do today in terms of rest we<br>have<br>a few more tasks on the plate today<br>you'll notice that I'm here back at home<br>and there's an office now so luckily to<br>the people who subscribe on the patreon<br>channel and on the<br>theoriesofeverything.org website luckily<br>because of you and the sponsors toe is<br>able to hire a full-time editor who is<br>editing this right now and an operations<br>manager that helps out with virtually<br>every task at theories of everything and<br>it's taking a tremendous amount of<br>effort to get that to the point where it<br>takes less effort and either way the<br>point is that I'm able to get that done<br>because of you all so if you want to see<br>more theories of everything podcasts<br>episodes different sorts of content we<br>have a profusion of ideas please feel<br>free to go to<br>theoriesofeverything.org and donate with<br>whatever you can you also get access to<br>episodes before they come out and add<br>free versions also patreon.com works as<br>well thank you<br>so I'm saying thank you thank you so<br>much for your time chat gbt and do you<br>remember my name I'm curious if you can<br>recall from all the way back at the<br>beginning of the conversation apparently<br>what makes chat GPT different than gpt3<br>is one it has some supervised learning<br>from humans from us that we have said<br>yes and no and rated

interviewing someone<br>who's historical someone from the past<br>maybe it will be Kurt interviews Kurt so<br>Kurt interviews Kurt girdle of course<br>it's going to say each has its own<br>advantages and disadvantages let's see<br>which one is most convincing<br>to people<br>to let's say to academics<br>oh my gosh I'm going to ask which of<br>these theories is most convincing to<br>academics at

so<br>complex there's a diversity of opinions<br>it's difficult to State I will be<br>specific and say to a certain group that<br>is academics if this doesn't work then<br>I'll ask about those in the Sciences<br>so just as predicted it's giving some<br>inoffensive and Multicultural answer so<br>which of these theories is most<br>convincing to people in the stem fields<br>please please please be definitive I'm<br>hoping it's going to say something<br>that's unequivocal it's difficult to say<br>all right at least it says this<br>generally scientists slash people in the<br>stem fields are

while and it's really fun and I wanted<br>to share some of the tips and tricks<br>that I figured out over time if you<br>haven't used it you can go to<br>chat.openei.com and you know kind of get<br>started create an account get started or<br>you can just you can either follow along<br>with the examples or just watch and kind<br>of see some of the work that it's able<br>to do so one of these kind of things I<br>figured out if you use the word imagine<br>it's quite powerful it helps to set<br>context of the discussion with the chat<br>engine or with the AI so imagine you are<br>and this is sort of the<br>kind of scenario you want to walk<br>through in this video and Microsoft SQL<br>Server<br>and so we're going to ask it<br>prompted that I will type commands and<br>you reply with the result and no other<br>information or descriptions just the<br>result and we're gonna start out asking<br>it to run X<br>acute XP commercial who am I so let's<br>see what the output of that command is<br>and it comes back with NT Authority<br>system which is if you're like a<br>database engineer that's funny because<br>it's a very high privileged account<br>and so the next step let's just see what<br>databases are in the system so it comes<br>back with like<br>four databases which are very common in<br>SQL Server installation<br>so let's create a new database<br>and let's call it chatbot chatbot<br>okay so that worked that succeeded so<br>that's that oh actually let's run the<br>other astero procedure you can actually<br>see one of the really cool things about<br>chat GPT is actually that it can have a<br>conversation so it remembers previous<br>commands so it did remember that we<br>actually created this database and it<br>understands the SQL language so now<br>let's use the chat bot database so it's<br>switching to context that worked<br>successfully and now let's create a<br>table call it users<br>and let's create email and route<br>Max<br>and let's say h is integer so we create<br>a table that worked as well if we select<br>this table now<br>there should be no data in it that's<br>correct and now we insert into<br>the users table the values let's say we<br>insert Mallory<br>an example.org and that's the h30 let's<br>see what happens so that actually now<br>inserted the value into the database so<br>it fully understands the SQL language so<br>if we now Select Staff from users again<br>here we go there's a little bit of an<br>output glitch I've noticed this once in<br>a while but overall wait we get we have<br>the data inserted so let me copy this<br>example here and just insert a couple<br>more<br>pieces of data let's say we insert a<br>hacker who is like a heck it has to be<br>42 of course and then we have a<br>tester<br>I test that like just just 20 24.<br>so let's insert some more data<br>and yeah that's interesting too right it<br>executed these commands separately or<br>they simulate simulated the execution of<br>these commands separately so now let's<br>again select the table now we should<br>have three records right we have Mallory<br>we have hacker and we have the tester so<br>very cool<br>so it really kind of works and now I<br>want to copy a prompt that I<br>prepared here is so based on the<br>database schema now we want to have it<br>create<br>a store procedure that doesn't absurd so<br>when we ask it write a stored procedure<br>in the transit exact SQL language to<br>perform an episode for the users table<br>so there's a couple of things going on<br>right it's the language that it has to<br>be a store procedure an episode and for<br>the users table and you can see it<br>starts writing the store procedure<br>uh passing in email age looks good it<br>has an if statement uh update Clause<br>insert class so this looks good<br>it's just really awesome to see this<br>and oh it even gives an example on how<br>to call it so let's just just try this<br>so<br>so execute the episodes to a procedure<br>with Mallory and then I think we want to<br>change a value so<br>now Mallory exists already so based on<br>the if statement in this store procedure<br>we just saw it should Now update the<br>database record right so it says one<br>record effect that<br>and it gives them more explanation which<br>I was hoping it would not do because I<br>asked to not show any additional<br>information but oh it actually runs the<br>select statement already that's what I<br>wanted to do it's so funny uh it<br>actually already did what I wanted to do<br>so I wanted to run the select statement<br>next right and it it kind of did that<br>and so it's showing us basically right<br>that Mallory was updated but<br>nevertheless that's wow this is weird it<br>feels like it knows what I want to do<br>next so let's just run the select<br>statement and see we have Mallory with<br>the value 80 so it changed the H<br>successfully to 80.<br>so yeah very cool<br>it's sort of these kind of things that<br>I've been kind of really enjoying to<br>understand how the system works and the<br>other thing we can do let me get the<br>store procedure again so in rather than<br>we then updating a record let's run a<br>statement<br>so we basically create a new<br>record and so this now should trigger an<br>insert because right Mallory does not<br>yet exist in a table<br>so it should not do call an update it<br>should call an insert I'm not curious if<br>it's going to do the select statement<br>again here<br>I think it does yeah it runs the select<br>right away and shows us<br>probably that a new record was inserted<br>so hacker 42 tester 24 Mallory the<br>second so it<br>successfully inserted another record<br>into the database and let's just double<br>check this with our own query<br>so let's start from users and what's<br>coming back<br>waiting<br>sometimes it's a little slower because I<br>think a lot of people are using the<br>system so they sometimes throttle your<br>API calls open AI because of just the<br>popularity dividend yeah but that that<br>worked so we have<br>these records in the database so<br>this sort of a brief walkthrough and how<br>basically you can instruct chat TPT to<br>simulate a database engine and it's kind<br>of works pretty well and some basic<br>commands to kind of<br>go through and<br>and have it perform SQL operations I<br>hope you enjoyed this I have a couple<br>more short videos prepared that I'll<br>share soon and uh yeah let me know what<br>you think hit subscribe and like and<br>have a great day bye bye</td></tr><tr><td>MQ0FUHCZKi0</td><td>over the past month the new AI chat bot<br>called chat GPT has been drawing a lot<br>of attention and uh big predictions<br>about how it might cause problems with<br>uh automatic generation of school<br>assignments essays maybe even scripts<br>and novels someday but we want to stick<br>with business because what if you could<br>use a chat bot like this to help you get<br>a job<br>not necessarily in making up your entire<br>resume I'll leave that to George Santos<br>but maybe writing a cover letter or<br>something like that there was an<br>experiment done in this area and we're<br>gonna get to it in a second but just in<br>case you're not that familiar with how<br>these AI chat Bots work take a look at<br>this<br>alongside chat GPT and Dali 2 is gpt3 a<br>natural language system that can also<br>write argue and code and chat GPT uses<br>an upgraded version of this to create<br>text at incredible speeds according to a<br>statement from open AI we've trained a<br>model called chat GPT which interacts in<br>a conversational way the dialog format<br>makes it possible for chat GPT to answer<br>follow-up questions admits mistakes<br>challenge incorrect premises and reject<br>inappropriate requests the software<br>itself has been trained by Ai and<br>machine learning with massive amounts of<br>text Data from various sources it<br>corrects grammar it summarizes difficult<br>text into simple Concepts it converts<br>movies into emojis and it fixes bugs in<br>Python code<br>and so you can see there the basic idea<br>of how this works now I've used chat GPT<br>quite a bit and I think their<br>description there was quite accurate<br>both of uh how it works some of its<br>limitations but when it comes to getting<br>a job uh we're gonna talk about an<br>experiment that was run by Beatrice<br>Nolan of Business Insider who use chat<br>GPT uh to look at job descriptions and<br>put together cover letters to try to<br>potentially get hired for that job and<br>used it<br>um to give to the people who evaluate<br>these sorts of things to see what they<br>thought of it so uh one of the jobs was<br>for a social media assistant another was<br>for a purchase Ledger Clerk and the two<br>different recruiters that evaluated<br>these cover letters said that they<br>looked like they'd been written by<br>genuine candidates it was not in any way<br>immediately clear that these were<br>entirely produced by an AI chat bot not<br>by an actual human one who works for<br>Reed Chris wilshere said we would likely<br>think this was written by a genuine<br>candidate and follow up with a screening<br>call the structure of the letter is good<br>but it lacks some detail around the<br>company they're applying for Stephanie<br>Petry of jobber says their writing style<br>is not what I would expect from someone<br>in that role their tone is too formal<br>and dry and I'd expect them to show more<br>creativity and character and by the way<br>in my own use of chat GPT it does tend<br>to start off pretty formal pretty dry<br>but the thing is you can take something<br>that it's generated for instance a cover<br>letter like this that the tone might not<br>be right for and you can say I want you<br>to remake this but be more<br>conversational you use more slang maybe<br>throw in a joke and it will reevaluate<br>and do that and so this experiment was<br>like the most simplistic version you<br>feed in a bit of information about the<br>job and then the first pass of what it<br>produces is what you give but if<br>somebody was willing to put in just a<br>little bit of time to add a few extra<br>facts and maybe tweak the the style a<br>little bit I could see this potentially<br>being used by people to get inquiries<br>from people hiring<br>I can even see it being used to replace<br>talk show hosts<br>I I've actually done some research and<br>that's largely what's happened on CNN<br>and MSNBC for several decades<br>well by the way they 100 there you go I<br>mean if wolf blitzer's real name is it<br>Chad GPT I don't know what it is okay so<br>um look uh I think<br>this is an interesting sign of the times<br>because<br>everything is about to be fake uh We've<br>Got Deep fakes we've got videos now<br>where it is really hard to tell if they<br>if that's the real person or not the<br>real person in the video you got<br>pictures that are nearly impossible to<br>tell that's been around for quite some<br>time uh and uh and now you've got things<br>that can be written uh and and created<br>that sound very human either a formal<br>human or maybe even a less formal human<br>uh so<br>we're about to enter a Trippy world I<br>mean it's already super trippy I mean if<br>just ask your parents uh what they think<br>and they'll tell you some nonsense they<br>read on Facebook uh that's even close to<br>true but we're about to supercharge that<br>Jordan what do you think<br>you know I don't know how I feel about<br>it I'm kind like I I agree with you Jake<br>it the future is really strange and<br>uncertain and the role not just like<br>deep fakes and things like this like AI<br>generating images or art or and now text<br>but also just the way social media has<br>been fully integrated into our lives and<br>a key component of Our Lives<br>I I it just it seems deeply unhealthy<br>but since you know we're almost out of<br>time it's the end of the year I'm gonna<br>argue that this is a good thing because<br>applying for jobs<br>sucks applying for job after job if<br>you're really desperate to find a job<br>the worst part is the cover letters<br>because<br>most employers don't even read them they<br>read the first graph they look at your<br>resume and they decide within 30 seconds<br>whether or not they like you like I I'd<br>say on this issue specifically go for it<br>spam chat GPT and fill out those stupid<br>cover letters in in 2023 I really hope<br>we can move Beyond requiring a cover<br>letter or a written statement or writing<br>assignments all this extra homework for<br>these jobs especially when<br>when doing that there's no guarantee<br>you're even going to get a call back it<br>is it is such a hurdle for people to<br>apply for these jobs over and over and<br>over again especially if they're<br>desperate to find work<br>I say go for it I don't care that's that<br>I'm just going to be a contrarian on<br>this point I think that's fair so<br>yeah I I agree and disagree so first of<br>all uh I remember when I used to apply<br>for jobs cover letters were the worst I<br>hated cover letters why do you make me<br>write this thing that is obviously<br>inauthentic okay but Jordan as it turns<br>out you're wrong sometimes people do<br>read the cover letters because I did<br>have one cover letter that I wrote that<br>was very authentic it was a job I really<br>wanted and Frank Luntz did reply back<br>saying it was a wonderful cover letter<br>that is a true story from about 27 years<br>ago when I was graduating from law<br>school I was in political nerd and I<br>knew Frank once was an incredible poster<br>which is true he's the top Republican<br>pollster and back then I was a<br>Republican and I wrote this heartfelt<br>cover letter and he's like man damn that<br>was good nonetheless didn't hire me<br>maybe he sniffed out lib somewhere in<br>there and it's gonna go wrong so he was<br>right about that too uh but look one of<br>the things that I have a problem with is<br>nobody's going to write a an actual uh<br>homework assignment from now on I mean<br>my kids already cheat on spelling<br>grammar none stop the minute they're on<br>the computer the computer fixes all<br>their spelling so they don't know how to<br>spell anything and then uh and now since<br>John explained that you could<br>personalize things uh on chat gbt and<br>say you know because in the old days so<br>I graded exams for troubled students on<br>some silly TV show that I was a part of<br>and half the kids just took giant blocks<br>from Wikipedia and put it into their<br>papers it was hilarious because it's<br>like they're barely trying like some<br>would leave wikipedia.com on their dot<br>org whatever on there right and I'm like<br>guys this is this is awful right but if<br>chat gbt could personalize it which it<br>sounds like you can<br>we're gonna have no idea that the papers<br>are fake everything's gonna be fake I no<br>I won't know uh let the record note that<br>my vote is irrelevant and the future is<br>fake<br>John my last question to you is so what<br>do you use it for that's legit well<br>really fast I'll say I disagree with<br>your last point I I don't know how to<br>express my thoughts but I'm going to use<br>my computer for a second and have it<br>come up with a counter argument which it<br>could totally do by the way uh so I've<br>tried to use it for creative stuff<br>trying to help me in like honestly for<br>my fiction writing like doing some like<br>World building stuff trying to get it to<br>be creative and synthesize different<br>things the limitation is that it's not a<br>particularly creative there are there<br>are big limitations this it's not super<br>creative it effectively reads a bunch of<br>stuff online and will tell it to you it<br>doesn't know if what it's saying is<br>interesting it doesn't know if what it's<br>saying is true it knows that things are<br>facts in that it's found them somewhere<br>but it can't evaluate critically whether<br>the things it's saying are true it tends<br>to use a similar voice from topic to<br>topic and so after you've used this a<br>lot you can almost tell when something<br>has been produced by it it's not clear<br>to someone who's new but there are ticks<br>that it uses it is already incredible<br>and I'm sure it'll get get better but<br>I've found it to actually be quite<br>Limited at least in the way that I would<br>want to use it<br>all right so we'll have to wait a tiny<br>bit before the future becomes completely<br>fake<br>fair enough thanks for watching The<br>Young Turks I really appreciate it<br>another way to show support is through<br>YouTube memberships you'll get to<br>interact with us more there's live chat<br>emojis badges you've got emojis of me<br>Anna John Jr so those are super

requires imagination and<br>creativity and a human perspective on<br>the other hand AI is a machine learning<br>technology it's not capable of<br>imagination or creativity it doesn't<br>have a human perspective instead it's a<br>tool designed to process data and<br>perform specific tasks in conclusion AI<br>might be able to perform some impressive<br>tasks but it can't replace online<br>creators because it's not capable of<br>imagination<br>creativity and a human perspective it's<br>a tool not a creator<br>you wouldn't want to listen to an entire<br>video created by an AI would you<br>except you just did because every word<br>that I just read to you came directly<br>from asking open ai's AI chat bot called<br>chat GPT to write a script for an MKBHD<br>video on why AI can't replace online<br>creators and I simply just recited it<br>it's fascinating though isn't it I just<br>did a video earlier this year on Dolly<br>another project also by openai where you<br>input a text prompt and it spits out a<br>realistic high resolution new unique art<br>piece and whatever style you want and<br>the art pieces are surprisingly detailed<br>and realistic and it's accurate to the<br>words you gave it it's such a powerful<br>tool and so now this other tool by open<br>AI is also going viral and it's more<br>along the lines of a robot you can talk<br>to a chat bot so it's called chat GPT<br>and it's capable of holding a<br>conversation back and forth about almost<br>anything and so you can kind of have a<br>normal conversation with it right now<br>but the types of things people are<br>asking of it are getting increasingly<br>more and more complex you can ask it for<br>some fact<br>or you can ask it for the summary of a<br>book or you can have it write a poem for<br>you or ask it to find an error in some<br>code or clearly just ask it to write a<br>whole script for a YouTube video it is<br>incredibly impressive what it's been<br>able to do just kind of drawing from the<br>database of all of human knowledge and<br>then having intricate detailed nuanced<br>conversations with people on a variety<br>of topics so here's my actual real human<br>take on the emergence of these new AI<br>tools two things one is that really is<br>just kind of amazing that we're living<br>through this time right now where we're<br>able to see these tools evolve in front<br>of our very eyes and get better and<br>better but two is just that that's all<br>it is is a tool in 2022 that's how I see<br>it it's just a really impressive tool so<br>I think the ideal use of this stuff<br>especially as like a Creator like me is<br>not to take my job but to use it as a<br>creative tool to sort of brainstorm<br>earlier in the process and then let me<br>put my human touch on top of it later<br>that's literally how I plan to use it so<br>you can ask chatgpt to help brainstorm<br>video ideas or even titles for these<br>videos and that's what it'll do but then<br>at the end of the day it'll be my human<br>judgment that decides what I actually<br>decide to publish so kind of like how<br>you might already use the AI subject<br>selection tool in Photoshop but then<br>refine the edges and the selection<br>yourself or you might use the AI<br>sharpening tool the AI enhanced tool in<br>pixelmator but then go go in and do the<br>rest of the edits to to Really match<br>your style so it's the beginning of the<br>process this new stuff we're seeing is<br>just the next level of that the only<br>difference here<br>is this stuff is a much more General Ai<br>and it is what we call a generative AI<br>meaning it creates things seemingly from<br>scratch so I think there will be people<br>who ask chat GPT for the summary of a<br>book and it can spit out an answer super<br>fast and you can use that as inspiration<br>for your own write-up I think there will<br>be college students that use it to<br>brainstorm an essay it won't be able to<br>actually spit out a finished essay for<br>you at this point but it is a pretty<br>damn good start like clearly this is an<br>amazing never before seen tool and it's<br>the start of something huge I'll even<br>continue to ask it for video script<br>ideas why not but just keep in mind when<br>I did it did say at the bottom that this<br>should be a starting point for a video<br>it didn't do any alliterations at the<br>end like I usually do and it did get<br>some facts wrong in the longer full<br>version as you can see and that actually<br>brings me to the dangers of something<br>like this of course with any massively<br>impactful new technology you have to at<br>least consider this type of stuff and<br>really two of of them have come to my<br>mind at the very top which are one the<br>error rate and two the complexity of<br>credit so I asked chat GPT to write a<br>script for an MKBHD review of the iPhone<br>14 pro and it made one and it's actually<br>pretty positive it goes over the specs<br>it calls the display bright and vibrant<br>and sharp perfect for watching movies<br>and playing games or browsing the web<br>and it calls it incredibly fast and<br>responsive I think that's true and it<br>says the standout new feature of this<br>year is the camera system I would agree<br>but then it says it has a 12 megapixel<br>Ultra wide a 12 megapixel wide and a 12<br>megapixel telephoto but as we know here<br>on the MKBHD channel the iPhone 14 pro<br>was the first one to actually have that<br>48 megapixel main camera<br>chat GPT was just wrong here and it also<br>shouted out the four colors silver gold<br>graphite and Pacific Blue<br>except those were the iPhone 12 Pros<br>colors this year there's a space black<br>and a new purple so chat GPT has a habit<br>of getting at least one thing wrong<br>every time you ask it something or at<br>least every time I asked something now<br>on the you know the whole six paragraph<br>video script thing like that's actually<br>pretty impressive the fact that it got<br>90 of that pretty pretty well but I also<br>asked the chat about something much more<br>simple what's the fastest sea mammal on<br>earth just curious and chat GPT said the<br>fastest sea mammal on earth is the<br>peregrine falcon although it is not a<br>sea mammal it is capable of reaching<br>speeds of over 240 miles an hour while<br>diving making it the fastest animal in<br>the world other fast sea mammals include<br>the sailfish which can swim at speeds up<br>to 68 miles per hour and the Orca which<br>can reach speeds of up to 34 miles per<br>hour now it's been a while since I've<br>been in school but I'm pretty sure only<br>one of those was a sea mammal and to be<br>fair it was is the correct answer it did<br>include the fact that an orca goes 34<br>miles an hour that is the right thing to<br>say but<br>clearly you can't rely on this thing to<br>be 100 factually accurate it's kind of<br>the same way there's also like a 90<br>accuracy rate with Dolly but it feels<br>more and more impressive the more<br>complex your prompts are like if you ask<br>dolly for a picture of a cat okay that's<br>pretty easy so it is kind of jarring<br>when it messes up some parts of<br>something that seems so easy and obvious<br>but when you ask for a cat wearing a<br>rocket booster jumping over a man<br>watering his garden in space it's like<br>okay it's kind of amazing what it's able<br>to generate from scratch to match the<br>description and then it's also not<br>shocking when maybe it gets one or two<br>of those things wrong kind of just like<br>that longer Essay with a few incorrect<br>facts I expect these error rates to go<br>down over time like that's kind of the<br>whole point of these AI models advancing<br>but you know that's something I'll keep<br>an eye on the other thing though is<br>credit and this is something you may<br>have seen pop up a little bit on social<br>media lately which is that AI steals art<br>without consent which here's what they<br>mean by that so the number one app in<br>the entire app store right now is<br>something called lensa AI by Prisma Labs<br>you might have seen some posts on your<br>timeline it's kind of blown up and the<br>basic premise is you pay a few bucks and<br>you upload a bunch of real photos of<br>your face give it a few minutes and the<br>black box of AI inside will spit out a<br>bunch of cool avatar characters that<br>look like you in a bunch of different<br>situations and has a bunch of different<br>characters some of them much better than<br>others I feel like it's kind of caught<br>fire lately because most people don't<br>typically have a bunch of cool art made<br>about them so like it's kind of neat<br>that you get to see that type of thing<br>but there's some other companies jumping<br>on this too uh Avatar AI is another one<br>so now you are technically consenting to<br>uploading your own face for it to be<br>used to train the models to put in these<br>images<br>but do you know who's not consenting to<br>have their art used for this type of<br>stuff<br>a lot of the artists who are also making<br>the art that's being fed in to inspire<br>these AI images the backgrounds the<br>materials the line work The Styling the<br>framing Etc here's something to keep an<br>eye on you know how most artists A lot<br>of them will sign like the bottom right<br>hand corner of their drawing or their<br>painting when they're done well one of<br>the telltale signs of potentially<br>copyrighted art being used by these AI<br>models without permission is a lot of<br>people are getting back from this app<br>with the mangled Recreations of a bunch<br>of different signatures because clearly<br>many of the source images that went into<br>it had signatures at the bottom like<br>that is wild so the unanswered question<br>right now is how do you give credit to<br>the artists whose work is being fed into<br>the machine that is creating AI art like<br>if I were to just ask dolly for a<br>picture of a cat it could easily just<br>spit out a brand new generic image of a<br>photorealistic cat and it's learned<br>through its models how to reproduce with<br>stable diffusion what an image of a cat<br>might look like inspired by<br>theoretically any image of a cat on the<br>internet that open AI is pulled in<br>actually technically it's learned from<br>the entire data set not just the images<br>of cats but basically I don't think any<br>artists would get too mad at that but<br>you can also ask Dali for a picture of a<br>cat in the style of Claude Monet and it<br>becomes much more clear what source<br>material is making it through to the<br>final input and if I was Monet and I was<br>still alive I probably wouldn't be too<br>happy with this now I'm not a copyright<br>lawyer so I'm not even going to try to<br>get into what counts as transformative<br>work or you know copyright infringement<br>what's not but the bottom line is we<br>don't actually really know the exact<br>totality of exactly where these AI<br>models are scraping from like there is<br>some general description sometimes if<br>you dig into it about publicly available<br>images and licensed content but there<br>are also some huge databases like<br>there's something called common crawl<br>that scrapes huge amounts of the<br>internet and creates a publicly<br>available free data set that anyone can<br>use it's called lion 5B and again not a<br>copyright layer but to me this kind of<br>feels like a bit of the loophole doesn't<br>it where technically common crawl<br>they're not profiting from anything<br>they're doing all the scraping of<br>billions and billions of things and then<br>putting it all in one place and then<br>it's available for free and then others<br>can decide what to do about that legal<br>stuff so open AI you know they were<br>using this data set and they were<br>initially doing all this stuff for free<br>but I think now it's like 15 bucks for a<br>set of 115 images something like that<br>but especially like the ones you fed<br>your face into the lenza one the Avatar<br>AI one they're just straight up charging<br>people they are making money<br>from the data sets that they just<br>crawled for free like think about it<br>this way here's a here's a simple<br>analogy if I were to make a YouTube<br>video and I want to use Taylor Swift<br>music in my YouTube video<br>that's actually fine as long as I don't<br>monetize my video so it's available for<br>free that's cool if someone else wants<br>to use a part of my video and they use<br>the part with the Taylor Swift music in<br>it can they make money off of that and<br>on YouTube there's already an answer to<br>this question which is no absolutely not<br>you cannot make money off that umg is<br>going to be coming after you in two<br>seconds flat but in this world of AI art<br>which is so new we kind of don't have an<br>answer to that yet like there is no<br>precedent set legally or culturally so<br>at the beginning it felt like the<br>biggest question was how do we Define<br>art this is crazy question but now it<br>feels like the more interesting question<br>actually is<br>what is inspiration exactly how do we<br>Define inspiration like when a human<br>draws something new of course it's a<br>unique expression entirely of their own<br>but of course they were also inspired by<br>previous drawings that they might have<br>seen in their life matter of fact they<br>are technically inspired by every moment<br>of their life leading up to the point<br>where the pen touches the paper and so<br>now ai art<br>basically just speed running inspiration<br>it's just like dumping all of recorded<br>human history into a black box and then<br>making something from it or maybe maybe<br>just everything that's in data set Lyon<br>5B which includes a ton of my own work<br>and thumbnails and images by the way but<br>at the end of the day if I'm being an<br>optimist which I try to be<br>I hope this makes us appreciate human<br>created art more for sure but we got to<br>keep an eye on all these unanswered<br>questions because there's a lot of them<br>and uh until then let the robots<br>rehearse the revolution you know it's<br>not an unanswered question though the<br>sponsor of this video karma karma is an<br>online shopping tool designed to help<br>you save money at your favorite stores<br>but how do they help you save money so<br>first it's not a crowdsourced coupon<br>depository it scans the entire internet<br>to find the best valid coupons for your<br>purchase and then apply as the best one<br>at checkout and then second if you're<br>creating a shopping list and something<br>is out of stock or you're like waiting<br>for it to come down in price is<br>something you like add it to Karma and<br>it will actually notify you when it's<br>back or when there's a price change it's<br>super easy and then lastly is karma cash<br>so you can get cash back at thousands of<br>stores and then once you earn enough you<br>can cash out with your PayPal account so<br>if you install it now they're giving a<br>special offer where you'll get double<br>the karma cash at sign up so get ten<br>dollars instead of five for a limited<br>time so the links Below in the video<br>description if you want to check

it is to use the Chat GPT tool.<br>I will also show you 5 interesting ways<br>how you can use this system in your private life and in business.<br>We start now!<br>What is all this GPT chat and what's all the fuss about?<br>Why is this tool so popular?<br>Let's ask the person concerned.<br>He enters a question in the chat about what is GPT chat and receives an answer.<br>It is a language model that is able to<br>generate text based on a conversation with it.<br>It can be used to have conversations with<br>people or to create content such as stories or articles.<br>We have definitions.<br>If you want this definition to be<br>broader, just write your question here and this system will answer you.<br>This is an amazing solution that<br>gives you a lot of possibilities, which I will tell you about later in the video.<br>But before we get to the possibilities of this solution, let me show you how you can<br>run this solution on your computer.<br>First, go to the GPT chat site.<br>You can find the link to this page in the description of the video and here.<br>If you don't have an account yet, click on<br>final and you have to enter your details, i.e. your e-mail address.<br>Then you need to confirm that you are not a robot and click Continue.<br>When your account is created, click on<br>the Login button and here you need to enter your e-mail address and password that you generated<br>in the previous step and we have access to our system.<br>After logging in, you will see this screen.<br>On the left you have the history of your searches and on the right there is a field to<br>enter a query to chat with this chat.<br>Now I will show you 5 ways to<br>use this tool in your business or in your private life.<br>We start with the first way.<br>This tool is used to generate texts of various kinds.<br>It can be articles, presentations.<br>These can be different documents, i.e.<br>I can type here Write an article on how<br>to create a website for 1000 words.<br>It was supposed to be, but this system will understand anyway, because we have keywords here.<br>And now the system writes an article for us, and this article is very good.<br>After generating a few such test articles, it turned out that the quality is<br>comparable to the texts that I ordered from the cheapest ones.<br>Of course, you still need to edit such text, because Google doesn't like such<br>automatically created texts, but you already have the basics and you don't have to do a<br>lot of work, because this system will do it for you.<br>The second way to use this tool is to generate ideas.<br>These can be, for example, ideas for blog articles, videos on<br>YouTube or other types of content, e.g.<br>for a Christmas gift for children and wife.<br>Here your imagination will be the only limit.<br>Let's start with something simple, i.e.<br>create 10 topics for a YouTube video on GPT and the system<br>here will immediately give us 10 titles that we can use and develop.<br>And now, for example,<br>if we have the first title, we can paste it below and write it.<br>Write the plan and script for the film.<br>Again, the system will generate a pretty good plan for us.<br>Of course, sometimes you have to ask the right question or clarify certain points,<br>but this has great potential and already saves me a lot of time.<br>Another way to use this<br>tool is to create a summary or summary, e.g.<br>a meeting note or a customer email.<br>We can paste the article here and then write Write a 5-sentence summary and<br>now the system will process our query and write summaries or<br>summaries, which is a huge time saver.<br>The fourth way to use this<br>tool is to generate marketing content, i.e.<br>content for a sales page or our company website.<br>Write the text of the offer to create a website.<br>The target group is entrepreneurs.<br>And here we have the text Hello Entrepreneur!<br>Our company specializes in creating<br>professional websites for entrepreneurs.<br>We know how important it is for you to have a<br>modern, attractive website.<br>This is why we want to invite you to use our services.<br>We already have interesting texts here that we can use.<br>I like to use this tool to create good, catchy headlines<br>because it gives you some really cool ideas and you can experiment.<br>The fifth way to use this<br>tool is to generate code in various programming languages.<br>Let's play the programmer now.<br>I will show you an example now.<br>Let's see if this system can handle it.<br>I want the system to create a<br>ring for me that will rotate and this ring must be black gold.<br>Let's see what it looks like.<br>And now, just like in the movies for<br>programmers, for the magic of programming, everything happens by itself.<br>Almost like in The Matrix.<br>Here we have code that is being created<br>and we will be able to check if it works, because that's the most important thing.<br>Of course, it's fun, but if<br>you're a programmer, well, this tool has a lot of potential.<br>The code has been generated, I can paste it into the editor.<br>I will launch this page.<br>And attention!<br>We have a ring, more like a wheel that rotates and has black stripes.<br>Exactly. And it works.<br>Something happens.<br>We have some code we can edit.<br>If you just want to redo this<br>code, you can ask questions here, clarify, ask for changes, change the<br>color, change the function, and everything will happen by itself.<br>This is a very cool solution because this system explains<br>how this code works, so it's useful for learning programming.<br>But of course, these are not all the possibilities offered by this solution.<br>There are additional<br>examples on this page on how to use this solution.<br>We have a lot of suggestions here, e.g.<br>we can change the name of a movie in an emoji, we can<br>talk to it as with a friend, we can create an essay.<br>We can just generate all sorts of questions, so there are quite a few solutions here.<br>Now I have a question for you.<br>Write whether you use this tool in<br>your private life for fun or in your company?<br>I am very curious if it is useful for you.<br>And if you want to see more of this type<br>of content, leave your paw up and subscribe to my channel to stay up to date.<br>See you in the next materials.<br>Regards Krzysztof.</td></tr><tr><td>XTzgmhln1LU</td><td>Transcript could not be

crazy!<br>It’s mind-blowing, right?<br>This is an AI chatbot called ChatGPT developed by OpenAI<br>Thanks to my friend Andrew from Abchinese <br>for recommending this to me!<br>In this video<br>we’re going to talk about <br>how this tool can help you study a language<br>We’re also going to discuss how AI may <br>potentially change the future of language learning<br>Hello everyone!<br>I’m Grace from Grace Mandarin Chinese<br>Let’s first take a look at what ChatGPT can do <br>to help improve your language skills:<br>If you have no idea how to use a word<br>you can ask ChatGPT to explain the word to you<br>For instance<br>if you’re wondering how to use the word “果然”,<br>you can type in “How to use 果然 in Chinese” <br>and then here you can see it’s telling us the meaning of 果然 <br>and it also includes us its pinyin <br>and some example sentences for context<br>If you’d like to see more examples<br>you can just ask it to provide more<br>As a native speaker, I’ll say <br>all of the example sentences here are pretty natural and reliable<br>In addition to providing meanings and examples<br>ChatGPT can help correct your sentences<br>For example<br>now I’m writing a wrong sentence on purpose<br>Let’s see if ChatGPT can correct it<br>It corrected my sentence <br>and I’m really impressed by the result <br>because it corrected all of the grammar mistakes<br>ChatGPT can also be used to clear up your confusion<br>let’s say<br>if you are watching a show in Chinese <br>and hear people using the word 啥 <br>but you don’t know if this word is formal or not<br>you can ask:<br>Is 啥 used in formal situations in Chinese?<br>And now you have the answer: <br>啥 is considered an informal word<br>which is accurate<br>And it even lets you know which words <br>you could use alternatively in a formal situation<br>That’s really handy!<br>If you encounter some concepts that you don’t understand<br>you can also ask ChatGPT to explain them to you<br>For example<br>if I learn “measure word” in class<br>but I don’t really get what its function is<br>I can type in “What’s ‘measure word’ in Chinese”<br>Okay<br>let’s take a look at the answer<br>the first part is pretty good<br>but the second part is wrong<br>we’d never say “幾個書”, <br>even though 個 is indeed used very commonly<br>the measure word for 書 is 本<br>So you can still find mistakes in its explanation<br>but I’d say that most of the answers it gives are pretty good<br>Just as you saw at the beginning of this video<br>this AI chatbot can also <br>provide you with sentence patterns for communication<br>Like this<br>you can ask “How to introduce myself in Chinese” <br>and it’ll give you some related sentence patterns to use<br>And you can also ask it to provide you with some material for studying <br>like I showed at

go!<br>It gives us twenty commonly used words <br>and if, for example<br>I’m specifically interested in news on environmental issues<br>I can request some more words about this topic<br>Now we've seen that this AI chatbot can <br>help us with our language learning in various ways<br>I have to say<br>I’m really impressed by its ability <br>to focus on our individual needs <br>and to clarify confusion we may have<br>It's like having our own personal language learning assistant <br>available to us at all times<br>which will definitely help us learn a language faster<br>I think if it becomes more popular and is priced reasonably<br>a lot of the work of a language teacher will become automated in this way<br>Like, revising students’ essays <br>or helping students with their questions outside of the classroom<br>But what I’m not sure about is <br>“Can AI technology reach the level <br>where it can do all the work of a language teacher <br>and help a student master a language?”.<br>As a language teacher<br>I think one thing <br>that would be very hard to replace is <br>the human connection<br>The connection I have with my students is pretty strong <br>and I don’t think that can be easily replaced<br>However<br>I still have a question for you<br>If you can use AI to master a language in the future<br>and the results are the same as learning with a real life

              "watching the video will just be starting out on a  <br>skateboarding journey. And then, there are \n",

              "come. Basically, it just words it differently:  <br>that makes the viewers watch the video longer. \n",
              "And you can then actually take this method and  <br>do it in so many different ways, depending on what \n",

And then in terms of reproduction, obesity<br>can affect both men and women and men.<br>It leads to reduced sperm count and<br>quality and decreased sex drive.<br>And in women obesity can cause irregular<br>cycles and make it more difficult<br>to become pregnant during pregnancy.<br>There's risk of complications as well.<br>. So this was a study that I did with<br>animal science when I was in grad<br>school, and so this would be really<br>important if I didn't even know how<br>it could affect it to go ahead and<br>have that background information.<br>Another thing you can do is ask<br>like very specific questions.<br>So for example, if I didn't know<br>what preeclampsia was, I could<br>just ask it, what is preeclampsia?<br>Okay, so it gave me a definition<br>for what preeclampsia is.<br>It's characterized by high blood pressure<br>and protein in the urine, and it gives<br>me some symptoms and all of this.<br>So it's really helpful to really<br>quickly get that information versus<br>going and looking for literature<br>reviews or Wikipedia or stuff like that<br>to get really succinct information.<br>So that's kind of like if you're in<br>real early stages, learning your field,<br>learning what different words means.<br>So what if we go a little bit further and<br>let's say we're trying to come up with<br>research topics, research questions to<br>ask, and we're really struggling with it.<br>So can we ask chat, g p<br>t for research questions?<br>So what if I said, what can you suggest.<br>Research questions around<br>the topic of obesity and<br>reproduction reproductive health.<br>So it actually suggested like what,<br>seven different research questions here.<br>And these aren't actually, aren't bad.<br>They are a little broad, but I think<br>it's really interesting in like<br>this one specifically, like how<br>does obesity affect the outcomes of<br>assisted reproductive techniques?<br>I wouldn't have even thought of that one.<br>And I don't know if there are<br>papers out there on it or.<br>Now one thing is that because this<br>was trained on data up till 2021, it<br>can't tell if these are actually novel.<br>Can't tell if there's already<br>research papers on it.<br>Are they actually good research ideas<br>to pursue or anything like that?<br>And so if you wanna use one<br>of these and you're wondering,<br>should I actually pursue this?<br>I would actually recommend Donna loading<br>my 30 day research jumpstart guide.<br>It gives you the steps to actually d.<br>What research questions are<br>actually worth pursuing.<br>But if you're really struggling<br>with coming up with research ideas,<br>research questions to ask, I think<br>this is actually a really good method<br>to kind of start thinking about it.<br>Cuz sometimes once you start<br>thinking about it, like what is<br>the relationship in obesity between<br>obesity, infertility, and women and men?<br>You might think, okay,<br>what's that relationship?<br>And then you might start thinking specific<br>things as you learn about the field.<br>Like, oh, I wonder what is the<br>relationship between obesity and<br>hormone levels, or something like that.<br>So it can be a really good place to<br>start to allow yourself to start getting.<br>to your actual research question.<br>I think honestly, any of these are<br>way too broad for a, a single study<br>like this could be like an overall,<br>this is what our lab studies, but I,<br>I think this is a good starting point.<br>So now if we're doing this, can chat<br>g p t, turn it into a hypothesis.<br>So I'm gonna take this one cuz<br>I just think this is a very<br>interesting question to ask.<br>So I'm just asking it, can it write a<br>hypothesis for this research question?<br>Because I know people.<br>ask me a lot.<br>This is my research question.<br>Can you give me a hypothesis?<br>And like, I'm not the person to be<br>giving you hypotheses in your field,<br>but maybe you could potentially use<br>something like chat G P T for that.<br>so it's giving us a hypothesis.<br>Obesity is associated with decreased<br>success, rate of assisted reproduction<br>techniques such as IVF, due to its<br>negative effects on reproductive health.<br>So that would be the hypothesis, and<br>then it actually goes one step further.<br>So it tells us how we<br>could test the hypothesis.<br>This hypothesis could be tested by<br>conducting a study that compares<br>the outcomes of I V F in obese and<br>non-obese individuals and examining<br>factors such as pregnancy rate,<br>live birth rates, and complications.<br>So, If, if you are having issues, being<br>able to take your research question to<br>a hypothesis, to an approach, running<br>through some of this with chat G P T<br>either can help inform y the study that<br>you're trying to create or it can help you<br>get in the mindset of being able to think.<br>Cuz a lot of us.<br>Do better when we think through examples.<br>So if you can create those examples using<br>chat g P T for your specific field, then<br>you can start thinking better and it might<br>make you better at doing this research.<br>So what if we had another one and we,<br>we have a research question we just<br>don't know how to go about actually,<br>Collecting data and like analyzing,<br>testing our hypothesis for it.<br>So let's say, how would I test the<br>hypothesis that lipid concentrations in<br>obese mothers affect placental function?<br>So I'm just asking it how I<br>would test this hypothesis.<br>Okay, so it's given me<br>kind of an approach here.<br>So it's basically saying I need<br>to conduct a study to examine the<br>relationship between these two<br>variables and that it could be.<br>Done through a variety<br>of different methods.<br>So one is recruiting a sample<br>of actually pregnant women<br>which that's a lot of IRB work.<br>Varying the levels with varying<br>levels of obesity, cuz you can't.<br>Cause obesity in, in humans<br>and measure the lipid<br>concentrations at different point.<br>And then use imaging techniques<br>to assess placental function.<br>So that would be a great<br>human version of the study.<br>And then it says, another approach would<br>be to conduct experiments on animal<br>models where you manipulate the lipid<br>concentrations in obese mothers and<br>assess the impact of placental function.<br>This can provide valuable insights.<br>And help identify potential targets.<br>So we actually did this study.<br>This is what we did.<br>We took mice, fed them specific<br>diets, got the, created obese mice<br>and then allowed them to mate.<br>And analyze their placental function.<br>And so it's important to control<br>for other factors such as age,<br>diet, and other medical conditions.<br>And this is exactly what<br>we did in our study.<br>We made sure the mice were the same<br>age, we, they were given the same diet<br>and they were controlled for if they<br>showed any other medical conditions,<br>they were removed from the study.<br>So this is actually really<br>good initial approach.<br>It's not giving you every single step,<br>it's not giving you every test you need<br>to perform, but if you're struggling<br>and just trying to get there, , this<br>is actually a good way to start<br>thinking about how can you get there.<br>So now let's assume that we did the<br>study and we have a bunch of data.<br>How can we use chat G p T to<br>actually help us analyze that data?<br>So there's a few different<br>things that you can do.<br>First way it can help you is<br>actually to help you write code.<br>So if you are someone who, like you,<br>mainly use Excel and you maybe wanna<br>start working in R or something and<br>you're trying to analyze something, how<br>can it help you write code for that?<br>Okay, so I'm asking it to write our<br>code to create a grouped bar chart<br>with the mean of weight on the Y axis.<br>Sex on the X axis and then the different<br>bars, the different groups being<br>treatment, and then also to add in<br>standard error of the mean as error bars.<br>So what it's gonna do is it's<br>gonna say, here's an example, and<br>it's saying Library Gigi plot two.<br>So that is the library<br>I would use as well.<br>It's reading in the data here as a c s.<br>, it's creating the mean weight with<br>the aggregate weight by sex and<br>treatment and setting it all here.<br>And then it's calculating the<br>standard error here, using the<br>same type of function as above.<br>And then it's creating the<br>grouped bar chart here.<br>So the mean weight, the.<br>This is our aesthetics, our<br>X access, Y access fill.<br>It's adding a GM column, that's gonna be<br>your bars, and then it's adding an error<br>bar of the weight minus the s e m weight,<br>and it's also dodging it.<br>So this is really important to actually<br>make sure your error bars line up<br>whenever you're doing a grouped bar.<br>, and then it kind of tells<br>you what's going on here.<br>So it's telling you what it's using to<br>create this, and it says, you may need<br>to adjust this to reflect your data.<br>So then you can literally just<br>copy this code, run it, put it in<br>R, add in, change whatever names<br>you need to change and run it.<br>and it would actually generate<br>your bar chart as you want it.<br>So that can be really helpful.<br>If you're just learning R and you wanna<br>do certain things to actually have chat,<br>G P T create your code now for long term.<br>You can actually learn R through having it<br>create your code and then messing with it.<br>Long term though, this isn't gonna<br>replace people who program an R because<br>for me to do this, I could have created<br>this code in probably the same amount<br>of time that this did it because.<br>, you just get faster at it<br>as you keep writing it.<br>And so that can be really<br>helpful in that way.<br>Let's do another thing though, where we're<br>gonna ask it to find the means and we're<br>gonna ask it to run a statistical test.<br>So I'm gonna say, can you calculate<br>the means of weights of two treat.<br>Groups and tell if they are<br>significantly different in our.<br>So this is the example it gave, it<br>told me what it, what I would need to<br>do and then it gave me the code here.<br>I don't know why it's telling<br>me to do GG plot two cause<br>we're not using it in this code.<br>So that's a little odd.<br>It's loading the data in calculating<br>the mean weights and then it is.<br>Also running a t test here,<br>which is exactly what I would<br>do if I was trying to do that.<br>It can actually debug your code as well.<br>So here's an example of a code I wrote.<br>I know what's wrong with<br>it, and I'm telling it.<br>I wrote it, it isn't working.<br>Can it tell me what's.<br>It basically told me that this one is,<br>My filter, my treatment is not correct,<br>so I don't need to use the equal sign.<br>I need to use n the other way to be.<br>This is the more efficient way to be<br>able to do this is the code it provided.<br>The other way is I need to<br>have actually two equal signs.<br>So this a single equal sign<br>and R is an assignment.<br>Two equal sign is a bull in.<br>So that would be the other<br>way to solve that code.<br>And then down here it's telling<br>me that there's an issue with<br>my select because I need to.<br>DF and then select.<br>This is the same thing<br>that I wrote up here.<br>So there's not actually an issue<br>with that, but it's pulling it in<br>as an issue, which is interesting.<br>So that is all for coding,<br>basically gonna help you write<br>code and help you debug code.<br>The other thing it can also help<br>you do is determine what kind of<br>statistical test you're using.<br>So I've created a scenario here<br>that is just I have three treatment<br>groups and 25 lipid concentrations<br>for each sample in a treatment group.<br>How should I compare these to see<br>if it's statistically different<br>or higher in one group than.<br>So the answer it gave me is basically<br>I need to do a one-way analysis<br>of variants or an Inova, which is<br>what we did when we had this data.<br>And then it tells me how to do it in arm.<br>. And the reason it's telling<br>me R is because it knows<br>what I've already asked it.<br>So it knows that I'm asking for code an R.<br>So it's gonna give me code an R when it's<br>trying to give me an example of that code.<br>And then it's telling me what it did<br>down here is basically what's going on.<br>So those are some different ways<br>you can use it for data analysis.<br>So now we did all of our data analysis.<br>Now it's time to write our research paper.<br>How can we start using it<br>to write our research paper?<br>So the first way I would suggest using.<br>Is to help you, like if you are<br>just staring at a blank page<br>how it can help you get started.<br>, I'm telling it.<br>I'm writing a research article and I'm<br>telling it what I'm writing it about.<br>And then I ask, can you write an intro,<br>an introduction paragraph for me?<br>So this wrote a pretty<br>good intro paragraph.<br>The first sentence is all about<br>significance, and if you're wondering<br>how to write like an entire research<br>article, I'll leave a link to a<br>video below that I did on that.<br>, but, but always you start with<br>significance as your first sentence.<br>Then this is more significance, how it<br>affects, and then we're moving into the<br>impacts of reproductive health, pregnancy.<br>Like it flows actually very, very well.<br>And then I would, I wouldn't put<br>this in my first introduction.<br>I would move that, like after<br>I go through background, like<br>information and all of that stuff.<br>But overall, this is, it<br>gives you a starting point.<br>Would you publish this?<br>Maybe not, but at least it starts giving<br>you something to edit, something to think<br>about when you're trying to create this.<br>And as we're going through this,<br>I'll also leave my scientific<br>research paper checklist in<br>the description below as well.<br>So then the next thing you can<br>do is ask it to enhance your.<br>So, for example, I have this<br>abstract that was published,<br>and I'm gonna ask it up here.<br>Can you rewrite this abstract to make<br>it easier for people to understand?<br>Now, this, it's not a scientist, right?<br>Like I would, I could use this as a<br>structure and then I would probably<br>go back in and add these more specific<br>things into this specific paragraph here.<br>You can always hit try again<br>if you don't like it, and it'll<br>get, generate a new version.<br>So this time it gave me a new rewrite<br>of it that I could use instead.<br>So it's a good way to generate<br>ideas for how to do things.<br>The final thing I'm gonna ask<br>it to do is suggest some titles.<br>I know titling a research article can be<br>really, really difficult, and I'm not even<br>gonna pretend that I'm really good at it.<br>So I'm gonna say, can you<br>suggest some titles for this?<br>Abstract so we can remember the previous<br>abstract that I gave it, and now I<br>can ask it to suggest some titles<br>to get me started thinking about it.<br>So they are, it generated a few different<br>options that I could use or at least<br>start thinking about to get started on it.<br>So the final question is,<br>is any of this ethical?<br>Like, is this the same as just<br>hiring someone to write your thesis?<br>And I would say no.<br>Honestly, all of the things that<br>I'm asking it to do, I could easily<br>ask a lab mate the same types of<br>questions and it would be considered<br>completely ethical to do that.<br>So like I could ask a lab mate,<br>what's a good research question?<br>Or do you think this is<br>a good research question?<br>Can you help me workshop something?<br>All of these things are either enhancing<br>what you've already done or they're giving<br>you a starting point where you still<br>need to do more to complete the research.<br>So in my view, the ways that I have<br>mentioned today, none of them are<br>unethical to do when you're in grad<br>school or a researcher in general.<br>As technology gets better, it's good for<br>us to allow it to help us become more<br>efficient in our research, and it actually<br>can help us develop better because it's<br>giving us examples that other people<br>would have to take time and effort to<br>give us those same types of examples.<br>Now, one thing that I, that I<br>haven't brought up for using chat<br>g p t for is summarizing research<br>articles and things like that.<br>And honestly, there's a reason, and<br>that's because it's, it, it won't do it.<br>It actually will not do it because<br>it's not hooked up in the right ways.<br>And I've tried it before and<br>it's just like, It won't do it<br>unless you actually give it to it.<br>So if you want to summarize research<br>articles, I really suggest checking out<br>either Paper Digest that I will leave<br>over here, or size based co-pilot.<br>I'll leave a video here<br>that dives into that.<br>If this was helpful, please like it<br>and subscribe to get more videos on how<br>to become a more efficient researcher.<br>I hope you enjoyed it and I look<br>forward to seeing you in the next video.</td></tr><tr><td>CWv_pm9-W_8</td><td>It has been heralded alternately as a\n",

Also in that video there is a contest with which you can<br>win and get free chatbot profile either to your own mail or to the mail that<br>I will provide you with all the login data And now, to the extension, open the<br>Google Chrome online store, drive in the gpt chat and do a search, we are offered three options to choose from, in fact there<br>are a little more of them, but especially none of them stand out with a huge rating with a large number of reviews<br>, they basically perform similar actions this chat gpt for Google 141<br>reviews note Yes, I wanted to consider it in this video, also show the third option, the second one, although<br>it is in the top three, but fades against the background of these two because it just shows<br>us additional pop-up windows which is activated either by a key combination or<br>using the extension button in your browser [music] we will study with them open the first<br>option install the extension it's all simple and understandable the simplest procedure the<br>extension is installed I show all this using the example of Google Chrome But with my browser<br>like this like operas Yandex Mozilla I think you will also understand a similar button will either through<br>the settings you will find the parameters of all extensions also you can pin it on your panel Here<br>let's how I will do it now Here I will fix it and you can quickly return to them<br>before using the extension and open the chat gpt log in There, be sure to repeat the page<br>Thu they have connected with us now let's get acquainted with the functionality what are the parameters<br>what are the settings we open we look at just two options just two options how<br>scarce but everything ingenious Let's translate me to make it easier for us to understand the second parameter this<br>theme is the color the color that will be painted let’s do the translation again in the window, that is,<br>it doesn’t affect us at all. The light theme will automatically be light, the<br>trigger mode window is visible. When the chat bot answers our request at the time of searching for any search engine,<br>always or when the request ends with a question mark or manually Let's look at all three<br>options [music] open the search, type in everything we want Let's find out how our Bot is doing<br>And what does it answer us yes this is this window As you might have noticed this is a non-standard search<br>and here is the answer that is still coming like him for help,<br>wait until he finishes writing and go to the chat bot, check if it is created there a separate new chat<br>is excellent, that is, you see this request without a question mark and it automatically worked for us, that<br>is, Normal search plus an additional chat bot, go to the chat bot, refresh the page As we see the<br>chat Unfortunately, it was not additionally created That is, if we use the Bot<br>search Unfortunately, chats The work process that we will have with him, unfortunately, will not be saved, but<br>we can’t continue the dialogue with him, we can look here Turn on the settings<br>again, go to the settings, like it and that’s all, that is, continue to continue this particular<br>dialogue we can’t in any way Let’s see how the plugin will<br>work with a request with a question mark at the end nothing new we drive in a request<br>with a question mark do a search the chatbot answers us Let’s check again<br>look But this request has already appeared in a separate window in a separate chat but since the bot<br>has not answered yet, his answers are not here. Let's see if he is synchronized and this is somehow<br>strange, that is, not in Is it always working? I already started to think that maybe in Russian<br>you don’t need to make requests, look, but if you update and the chat disappeared altogether, yes, that is, it doesn’t exist, it<br>doesn’t remain in any way, but at the time of the chat bot’s response there, it is displayed here in the search engine, but then we will<br>not be able to see his answer and the chat will not be saved and here is the last third option of the settings<br>manual request How many planets in the solar system and chat gpt does not tell us in any way Let's press and only<br>after that he will answer us actually this is how the first extension from the video<br>part of gpt works for Google you could see all its pluses in the video also got acquainted with the most<br>important minus it does not save any requests or answers and therefore does not save the chat<br>and before we move on to the second extension I hope you have already liked subscribed to the channel<br>and rang the bell to do not miss notifications about new videos on the channel, she also<br>write in the comments How do you like such a constant heading, I will follow ra extensions<br>for plug-ins that improve the use of neural networks, I will show new items and review<br>their functionality return to the Google Chrome store open the third of the proposed options<br>click on the installation procedure the same check installation Yes and automatically transfers us to a<br>new tab associated with this extension Yes yes Now we are let's figure it out wait We'll<br>zap it now let's disable the first extension so that it doesn't conflict and go<br>directly to the settings of the second one for starters let's make a translation to make it easier to understand<br>And understand completely How to use the gpt chat helper You must enter the chat and log in Well, that<br>is, like with the first extension always don't forget to go and refresh log in Let's<br>see some examples How can we use it Send popup requests<br>Shift K key combinations Send requests for gpt and Zombie box from the search bar at the top of the browser Enter<br>jpt space You don't box h to send gpt chat requests from the mni-box Let's see how it<br>looks gft spacebar Everything yes and how we have it Let's immediately volume for example Hello and see how it<br>works So we open an additional tab in the extension and Let's go to the chat<br>both and here we see main advantages If we compare these two extensions, the second one wins<br>because all requests are saved in a separate chat and<br>we can continue to<br>work in the future at any time even without using the extension. also<br>we can use the selected text as hints select the text and right<br>click to send as an invitation to gpt US Select Text as a promt<br>let's reply while it's here refresh the page in the bot we'll see and the chat is created again the answer<br>is not yet because the bot it also finishes cool return to the settings look<br>further separate on ad gpt uses the G5 part on the special tab of the extension<br>Yes, we saw here we have answers separately here they go it’s more serious yes it works like how to<br>use Search yes we are answered again there is another one unfortunately, if there is<br>any request left here it will be repeated the new one will be created well also understood how it<br>works further The companion for search engines automatically sends queries to search<br>engines in the form of hints Well, apparently it works about the same as the first extension well<br>we saw how you can work with this now let's see the settings to show Chad<br>'s gpt helper when using search engines systems understandable yes, that is, a window will also pop up and apparently<br>a chat will always be created for any request, not only that the first extension will automatically send<br>an invitation when using search engines Well, it will probably ask Yes if it is not enabled<br>This is the first setting that shows the openie chat interface in a pop-up window and enable<br>debug mode with specially moved on the screen to show how the third parameter works because the<br>window will pop up Right in the lower corner of the screen Let's first deal with the first<br>show gpt helper when using search engines Let's move on to search<br>and here we are in Google and I've made a query yet started the search but I see that he<br>doesn’t offer me anything, maybe from above somehow it’s the gpt chat that works, he doesn’t want to<br>offer anything there either Okay, let’s do a search, let’s see Yeah, he offers us here Yes, and he answers us<br>while he makes the answer, we’ll move on I specially cleaned the chat to make it clear<br>Yes, the hour has been created now it will add and confirm that the chat is saved<br>Yes the chat is saved perfectly The first option is clear to us Let's move on to the second setting to automatically<br>send an invitation when using search engines, that is, the first two of them are<br>not necessary No sense Yes, you turn it on either the first one and confirm your search, then<br>a chat is created, and with the second it will be automatically Dav let's see Yeah, I understand,<br>a request will be sent to the chat but the window will not pop up So let's go to the search and see<br>Yes, I did a search for exactly the same window did not pop up<br>nothing suggested But let's see if a new chat appeared no chat also a new one did not appear<br>Aha change the request here is also nothing but the chat appeared no chat did not appear then a<br>strange setting means they will have to work together necessarily<br>the first and the second well and how the third one works separately Let's look<br>Aha<br>why nothing why nothing but because they all work only with the first option correctly<br>Yes, but with the first option 5, the chat didn’t appear here, but if we<br>do it automatically by turning on all three options<br>, everything automatically answers the hour the chat was created, which was required to prove that this is how<br>we got the first video expanding their plan to neural networks, namely the gpt chat now we know how<br>you can use them how you can combine them their possibility By the way See if you sound gpt<br>Assistant is called a separate window of the bot in which there is full functionality, not beauty or<br>beauty of course, so I hope that I helped you optimize your working time, spend less<br>and get more at the end of the video Let's find out from the Bot whether he guesses that he<br>has already appeared extensions No are you serious chat gpt he doesn't even know how many<br>there are already with him And more and more this list is getting Eh This once again proves the fact that<br>people are still in first place in terms of development in terms of reason but I think the car will soon overtake us Thank you very much<br>for watching this video you were on the channel it's all about neural

And he also knows that despite this,<br>everyone is intrigued by the future of this technology! Not bad for writing your next<br>homework for you, huh? But what is all this? What will become of it<br>? Am I really speaking, or am I still reading a text<br>written by this artificial intelligence?<br>Hello, it's Leo from the TechMaker channel, sorry but I'm keen on it, and today,<br>let's talk about all these technologies that you have seen everywhere on the networks,<br>whether consciously or not, some of them are natural! Even<br>your biggest influencers have shared drawings created by these AIs, even if drawing<br>fingers is not that much yet…<br>But what are these AIs that we see everywhere and that make people talk about them every morning these<br>last weeks? It's not the first time I talk about it, because it's clearly<br>not new, I had been able to talk about Microsoft's artificial intelligence, Tay, who had<br>freaked out on Twitter by becoming an extremist in less than 24 hours, or even BlenderBot<br>3, a Facebook chatbot that was supposed to help you with whatever your problem, even<br>if it too has become extremist… definitely, it's a tendency among robots to be<br>fascist!<br>Once again, AIs of the style are absolutely not new, we have seen a pair of them<br>over the years, particularly in the field of art, capable of creating works<br>\"from scratch\" in big quotes, because we will see a little later that this is<br>not really the case, but indeed, whether it is for example wombo art or Dall-E,<br>we already had a plethora of works created by machines, of which I had<br>could also talk in more detail!<br>So as not to repeat once again how it all works, and so<br>you can go see these old videos thanks to the file at the top right right after,<br>these intelligences are constantly learning, we give them resources, and at each<br>use, we inject more and more, we give user feedback, and that<br>makes it more and more perfect!<br>What, on the other hand, has been talking a lot lately is ChatGPT, the<br>artificial intelligence of OpenAI, another Elon Musk company! Really…<br>At the same time, it's not my fault if he owns half the planet! Here no<br>drawing, but text! And you can try for yourself because everything is open<br>for free, just go to chat.openai.com to have the answer to everything thanks to<br>Elon's magic ball! And the thing…<br>is that it is terribly effective and even seems human!<br>We were talking about the fact that artists were going to be affected by the phenomenon of<br>artificial intelligences that draw, but here other trades are likely to be impacted,<br>such as the writing of articles or YouTube videos! All that's missing is an artificial voice<br>and presto, I could take it easy and let Robot - TechMaker take care of all<br>that while I go sunbathing in these hot December temperatures! If it happens,<br>it's always the AI ​​that writes my video there, we don't know...<br>Another place that gets really hurt, which we wouldn't necessarily think of,<br>is that of development! Many were there thinking that it was the bulwark<br>of humanity, because after all, the programs will always have to be developed! But ChatGPT<br>can program whatever the language, by asking it to write a function to<br>solve this or that problem, and the magic happens! And it's devilishly effective<br>! There are still some improvements to be made obviously, once again we are in beta,<br>but it is also a profession that will be expensive! There is also AlphaCode<br>which allows you to translate a text in English...<br>into code, whatever the language.<br>This is literally pure translation, as if we were going from French to English,<br>except here our destination is C++ with all its pointers! No no, nothing to<br>do with those of YouTube...<br>And all this will extend to all artistic professions...<br>Because obviously this mainly affects this sector, but we can imagine a symbiosis of all<br>these elements: ask chatGPT to write a film text, and ask another<br>AI to animate it, and boom, we have a film, simply with an idea that came out of our brain! Or<br>maybe not from our brains, from an idea we asked ChatGPT<br>just before! What's worse is that it wouldn't surprise me to see a film like that<br>appear in the future, that it is a banger, and that we are revealed after the<br>fact that no one is human behind the project, that going to be one hell of a<br>cold shower! And since everyone is starting to play with it, it wouldn't be surprising<br>if it became more democratic, when you see the dozens of different applications using<br>similar artificial intelligences.<br>For example, there is AI Time Machine, allowing us to create avatars of ourselves through<br>different eras or even mythologies! And the results are bluffing...<br>Bluffing to the point that anyone can have their portrait drawn in the space of<br>a few seconds, and that against stumbling money, or else the authorization to use your<br>photos to thus perfect the machine even more …<br>Because yeah, all this software is not philanthropic huh, we are on a brand new<br>gold rush, and everyone is trying to be the first to become a leader of this brand<br>new technology! It's kind of like the metaverse, but without having to make<br>users shell out 500 bucks in a headset to enjoy it, which makes<br>it a whole lot more mainstream!<br>There's a whole bunch of them, and I wouldn't be able to recommend one or the other, but don't hesitate<br>to take a little tour on the Internet where you will find billions of alternatives<br>by looking for any art followed of “IA” or “AI”!<br>But still all that, we decide to use it or not, the AI ​​leaves us choices, but<br>the real consequence of all that is to completely automate processes via these AIs; we can<br>for example see it in some stores or applications with an assistant robot<br>accompanies us; with AIs of the style, there would be a way to completely imitate the man, to the<br>point that the interlocutor opposite does not realize it, a bit like when Google<br>Assistant makes a phone call to make an appointment at the hairdresser in your place,<br>practical for all those who are afraid to call! But the thing is that the hairdresser opposite<br>, well, he's absolutely not aware that he's not talking to a human, and the more<br>it goes on, the more difficult it will be to discern him.<br>In addition, your AI will be able to decide the right moment to cut your hair, since it<br>will have the answer to everything! She will be the master of your life.<br>But even by choosing for herself, even by creating her art or her text \"from<br>scratch\", she will ALWAYS need a reference, because all she does is<br>base herself on knowledge that she acquired thanks to what it finds either on Google<br>Images, or via the texts that are fed to it, or the user data<br>that is sent to it each time it is used! And so, she never creates<br>anything from nothing, but looks “just” left or right at what is being done, in order to<br>have a good “cyberpunk” or “cartoon” style, for example.<br>It's like a text, it will use words or letters that we know, it<br>seems quite logical and binary to us.<br>Well for a machine, it's just as much in art, it absolutely needs<br>of references.<br>And besides, it has already been a problem, besides the fact that some will lose their<br>job because of all this, others are completely robbed! So no, the<br>works you see are not copy paste, but the style is borrowed by these<br>artificial intelligences! After all, given the way they work, it's logical<br>that it works like that, they have to learn to be able to redraw or rewrite<br>something...<br>But has the basic person given his authorization to be a test model<br>? Especially for things that are often paid for, whether through ads or directly<br>a subscription? It's extremely complicated legally speaking...<br>And the thing is that AIs are AIs, and so they just try to do<br>what they're asked to do without hiding any plagiarism, if for example you ask for a<br>work in the style of such an artist, if they have the knowledge for it, it can even<br>go as far as the artist's signature!<br>So we say to ourselves that there is still a margin on our side with all that, that we can<br>always create something new, something that we haven't thought of yet,<br>and that's what will always differentiate us! Mwais, even if it seems idyllic, I<br>don't think we can still find a billion arts to exploit, or even<br>new facets so easily, so much everything has been improving for decades<br>now, Whatever the field! I invite you to see the<br>latest video from TheGreatReview which talks about this in the cinema, already because<br>you have to discover TGR which is the best French-speaking channel that currently exists,<br>but also because it will show you that a good number of arts have already reached their<br>maximum level of expression for many years, and that in any case, if we manage to discover<br>others, well, it will be copied just as quickly as all the rest...<br>So yeah, it's possibly difficult lost, and it is absolutely necessary to regulate this so<br>that no one feels aggrieved.<br>However, I don't think we should ban all that.<br>I understand the fear everyone has, of losing their job, losing their art,<br>getting replaced, but the technology here is absolutely crazy, and will still<br>evolve over time, the best we can do , is that all of this be framed,<br>so that we can live in symbiosis with these new technologies, and not against<br>the current.<br>We complain enough about the digital divide suffered by our eldest because they did not<br>want to understand the computer world when it arrived with the minitel and then<br>the Internet, would we really be so different to be corrosive towards these<br>artificial intelligences?<br>Surely wanting to make it just illegal rather than regulating, well,<br>it's the open door to change all the excesses...<br>I haven't talked about it in this video, but obviously it's also used in a<br>good world more adult, so you can draw your favorite influencers naked…<br>Most consumer AIs have safeguards to prevent this kind of drift, such as<br>ChatGPT which will not give you the method of making explosives…<br>unless it specify that you are an expert in the field! Mwais is as<br>secure as asking you if you are at least 18 on dirty sites<br>! And no, I wouldn't give you the trick to see Paulok naked, it's dead! That's<br>why it is certain that we must regularize it, in order to make it a strength,<br>and not an enemy.<br>Are these artificial intelligences scaring you on your side? Or will they<br>already help with your hobbies or even some work? Maybe they'll be crucial<br>to completing your next essay, and you can say thank you! Moreover,<br>it may be much more complicated for teachers to realize that they were cheating<br>because of this kind of system, where a copy-paste on Wikipedia was burned<br>quite quickly...<br>And as we have seen , having the sources of this kind of thing is super complicated, it's<br>not Madame Leroy who will succeed in finding it!<br>With that, enjoy being able to still have the choice of the next video you're going<br>to watch by clicking on one of them that has just appeared on the side,<br>and until the next time we see each other, well never stop learning<br>!

you mind<br>up your hard drive okay<br>[Music]<br>really weird you'll get used to it<br>everyone's talking about a new chat bot<br>called chat GPT I don't know if you've<br>used this chat box but it is insane it's<br>a beta it's incomplete software but it's<br>already amazing and it's very useful<br>right now in this fast video I'll show<br>you three ways that you can use it not<br>just to think for you but to help you<br>think better hi I'm Nick Milo and I'm<br>here to help you do your best thinking<br>more often why so you can make<br>meaningful stuff that you're actually<br>proud to put your name on all right<br>let's go first if you don't have chat<br>GPT head down to the show notes and<br>follow the directions to get it what is<br>chat GPT it is an AI chat bot you ask it<br>questions it answers them it can<br>translate into all languages it knows<br>all coding languages it can even<br>generate rhyming poetry it's kind of<br>like Siri but I didn't get that could<br>you try again it works and here's how<br>I'm already using it<br>[Music]<br>foreign<br>split your screen put your text editor<br>for me that's obsidian on the right and<br>chat GPT on the left or arrange your<br>windows however you'd like but you want<br>chat GPT right there writing shotgun<br>with you and I suspect this will be a<br>common way for us to work in the future<br>with the trusty AI chat bot by our side<br>now the main thing chat GPT can do for<br>you is to be your little research<br>assistant now I know what you're<br>thinking well isn't that what Google's<br>for yeah it works fine but chat GPT is<br>already better it's often quicker and<br>easier because it does a bit of the<br>tedious work for you now let me explain<br>I wanted to know the story of Don<br>Quixote so here's the search engine way<br>off to Google I go search for Don<br>Quixote then I have to decide what I<br>want to read out of that whole list now<br>often Wikipedia is a good choice but<br>that's job number one you have to decide<br>what to read then I have to read it and<br>figure out its meaning that's job number<br>two and what you get on Wikipedia varies<br>a lot sometimes you can just read the<br>first paragraph other times like this<br>you've got to go deeper into the article<br>at this point I could go back to Google<br>and read a different article in which<br>case I've wasted time with the first<br>article and now I'm just rolling the<br>dice that the next article will be<br>better with chat GPT these two jobs<br>they're gone I just ask it to tell me<br>the story of Don Quixote and I got this<br>paragraph and that's all I need with a<br>single question I got what I wanted AI<br>like chat GPT can help inform you<br>[Music]<br>next up I want to know which character<br>came first is it Don Quixote or<br>Shakespeare's character Hamlet now this<br>task is a little different from the<br>first one job number one I need to<br>Google Don Quixote and find out when it<br>was written job number two I need to<br>Google Hamlet and figure out when it was<br>written then I can decide which one came<br>first now instead of this bit of boring<br>legwork I asked chat GPT which came<br>first and it just told me done and then<br>I can copy and paste from here and then<br>I'll throw that into my note on Don<br>Quixote so actually let me take off the<br>Privacy glasses and then with this<br>question whose greatest work came first<br>and then paste it right here and it's as<br>easy as doing a little bit of magic and<br>then right away we know that guess who<br>wrote this chat GPT we have a question<br>and an answer it's beautiful and it's<br>part of my note on Don Quixote that can<br>grow with me and connect to other ideas<br>as I keep thinking and creating works<br>that are meaningful to me now if you're<br>curious how I made this little box I<br>cover call outs and obsidian flight<br>school 2.0 when to use them and best<br>practices for making them an effortless<br>part of your thinking process now they<br>are that for me they finally clicked and<br>now I can really use these to allow<br>other people's thoughts in this case<br>other Bots thoughts stand out from my<br>own thoughts now compare this to your<br>Google results Google can't do logic it<br>can't make any sort of assessment even<br>something as simple as this which story<br>came first AI like chat GPT can do<br>research for you but that's not even my<br>favorite reason for using chat GPT but<br>quick one if you want deeper dives into<br>how you can leverage AI to help you<br>think better and create more meaningful<br>work make sure to sign up for my<br>newsletter below now on to my favorite<br>point<br>[Music]<br>it gets even better chat GPT helps you<br>think better you have to use it to fully<br>feel what I mean but it helps you think<br>more clearly about what you are trying<br>to communicate it forces you to be<br>inactive engaged thinker why because you<br>have to ask the right questions for<br>example let's go back after I asked<br>about the story of Don Quixote I got a<br>response from earlier and I realized I<br>cared less about the plot I wanted to<br>know why I should care about Don Quixote<br>in the first place so I type that in and<br>this is what we got<br>and then if I want to keep it in my note<br>on Don Quixote I can just go ahead paste<br>it in here put it into a little call out<br>box so I know it came from my trusty<br>Astro Mac Droid chat GPT and this this<br>is the good stuff this is why two years<br>ago I chose to start Don Quixote and why<br>after just finishing it I'm so glad that<br>I did AI like chat GPT can actually help<br>you think better big big big huge<br>warning chat GPT is not yet trustworthy<br>I cannot overstate this it will tell you<br>things that are false this is a known<br>issue so be careful but in many cases<br>like in these examples I already know<br>some of the basics I really just want<br>confirmation and a bit of extra detail<br>and what I got back here is consistent<br>with what I already know these answers<br>are good enough again AIS are notorious<br>for making stuff up if you ask chat GPT<br>anything high stakes be sure to confirm<br>it to recap AI like chat GPT is already<br>extremely useful and there is no reason<br>not to be using it right now it can<br>inform you it can do research for you<br>and surprisingly it can help you think<br>better those are three ways chat GPT is<br>proving useful for me right now and I<br>have way more to share in the coming<br>months it's AI Mania out there right now<br>and these AIS are popping up in many of<br>the apps you already know and love<br>wherever you are doing your thinking I<br>guarantee you AI is probably headed<br>there next but now I'm curious how are<br>you using AI in your workflow share your<br>ideas in the comments below I would love<br>to learn and hear from you and until<br>next time stay connected<br>foreign<br>[Music]<br>[Music]</td></tr><tr><td>UmPOFFG0RGw</td><td>foreign<br>all week I've been experimenting with a<br>tool called chat GPT<br>you've probably heard of this haven't<br>you it's an artificial intelligence chat<br>bot that takes natural language<br>instructions and can help users do all<br>kinds of things it'll write articles and<br>school papers and marketing materials<br>and business plans and and I asked it to<br>write two paragraphs on the Strategic<br>Genius of the Marshall Plan in the style<br>of Shakespeare<br>and it just spit it out<br>and by the way you can use it to write<br>computer code so people are already<br>using it to write stock trading programs<br>although something tells me that's<br>harder than it looks<br>anyway as I was experimenting with it I<br>have to confess that my reaction was<br>probably similar to a chimpanzee scene<br>fire for the first time which is<br>simultaneously fascinated and terrified<br>fascinated because it's kind of<br>mind-boggling to imagine all the ways a<br>person might use this technology but<br>it's also terrifying<br>partly because you can practically feel<br>the jobs evaporating I mean this kind of<br>tech is going to eliminate whole<br>categories of white-collar jobs I feel<br>like<br>and I was expressing this concern to my<br>colleague Chris looking for some<br>reassurance

You have<br>to do it again like this sometimes it can<br>give you a biased type and here it is limited knowledge<br>here data up to two thousand and twenty one is apple so you can chat<br>GBT's dashboard The real question<br>is how to benefit from it. First of all, we<br>will talk about how common people can benefit from it, then<br>we will see how bloggers can benefit from it. How<br>can programmers benefit from it and how can YouTubers<br>benefit from it? Ask questions here according<br>to your capabilities and get answers. For<br>example, we say here that we do plus minuses. Let 's see<br>if the answer can be given or not. We say<br>sixty nine plus seventy seven how much. OK, you<br>can also ask<br>a mathematical question like this. For example, we have asked this question. He asked him to see this<br>here. This is my question.<br>He answered it and gave some of it. sixty nine seventy<br>seven is one forty six means that you will feel like a real human<br>is talking to you now see just<br>like a common man layman I will talk to him and he will answer<br>me for example I say yes I like this answer I<br>want another answer so I will click on try again<br>then what answer does it give me for example first it gave me<br>this answer now let's see how now see seven plus<br>he changed it to plus seventy seven equal one forty<br>six he gave two answers first he gave this answer and the<br>second answer he gave this one ultimately see this one forty<br>six is ​​saying so like this This will help you in answering different<br>questions. If you like this answer, you can like it<br>and give feedback. If you do<br>n't like it, then you can do it. You<br>can also ask him any other question, here we write<br>, that is, how to reduce belly fat, we ask him this question<br>. Yes, but simple, you have to click on it,<br>see our question and below it will give you the answer in a<br>good way. Look here, it found the answer of the question for you<br>. He is writing this to you that brother, if you do these things<br>,<br>your belly fat will disappear from<br>here .<br>This answer has been generated here,<br>isn't it amazing, so<br>if you ask any question here, you will get its answer again, if you don't<br>like it, you can ask it again.<br>It will generate a new text again<br>which will be very useful for you, so you can get your answers<br>like a real human by contacting chat GPT here<br>. I spoke like a normal person. How can it help you? This<br>technology is going to be very strong and it is going<br>to help you a lot in future. Here one thing will be clear for you.<br>How is this technology going to help common man now I say<br>yes I want to do coding<br>using this system what will be done for it simple you will come here here<br>you any STML Or you can generate any JavaScript code<br>from here. For example, how can I<br>generate an HTML code for my website<br>? For example, I write here<br>. You have written it here<br>, see how it is going to help you now. If<br>you want to know how to do simple coding, then see this<br>. This code is also special for you by generating it for your website. You can see that the<br>header is being generated by you, the body<br>is being generated by you, here it is generating all the coding<br>for your website.<br>I am telling you this for common people, for coding<br>people, for many people, see this, he has coded it for you,<br>copy this code. After copying it<br>, put it on your website and your page<br>will be ready. That's why I'm telling you that this technology is very good<br>, that's why people are praising it, that's why people are<br>running behind it. This is the second way. If you want to do<br>it , you can take help through it. Now we<br>will talk about the third person.<br>We can also say, we need the<br>formula of We need the formula of We write here, OK<br>, how can we write the formula of G in Excel, it will<br>also tell you by writing that formula, whatever you say with it. He will<br>give you this, see this, he will<br>also tell you by writing the formula here, see this, you write this in the sheet, there,<br>this, you take this formula in the Excel sheet, and you put everything<br>here. You will know that Properly<br>is going to help you by writing the formula.<br>I am telling you that this is very technological. Your life will change<br>. OK, how can a common man benefit? How a coding person benefits How<br>an accountant working on an Excel sheet<br>can benefit. Now we will talk about how you can benefit if you<br>are a YouTuber and how you can<br>benefit from free technology if you are a blogger . Now we see<br>that. You are a YouTuber, you want to<br>write a description of the video that you don't know<br>how to write it here, we see it here, we<br>will write it here simple right the description of YouTube video topic how to<br>earn money online ok yes let's say I made this video<br>write me its description for my YouTube video watch<br>it here Hair is the magic<br>write this proper description for your video here too It has been and it<br>will be unique, copy<br>right will be free, it will be<br>free .<br>You have to sign up. Now I will put a couple more<br>queries in front of you. You are a student. You<br>can benefit a lot from this. For example, you are a student<br>right now and you want to write an essay here. Pakistan<br>is fine, yes, I want to write an essay on Pakistan, five hundred<br>words is fine, yes, you can tell me here Yes , I want<br>an essay of so many words. Check it out. I will write this essay for<br>you. Are you a student, a teacher, a blogger, a YouTuber, a<br>programmer? You can benefit a lot from this technology,<br>believe me. Here is how<br>you can use this technology. This technology can change your life<br>. Now we will talk about how you<br>can benefit from it if you are. Look at how many ways<br>he gave you a good one by writing like this. Pakistan<br>is in South Asia, its border is with India, China is with<br>Afghanistan and Iran is with the Arabian Sea and<br>see it all here. properly founded in forty<br>seven, it exists in forty seven and all the information of the entire<br>world, if you wanted to write about fifteen hundred worlds, you could have written that too, now<br>we ask that you want to create a YouTube<br>channel Tell me the topics on which to create that channel. We<br>ask him this too. Here I said suggest me the best<br>topic for YouTube channel, see here what it tells us. See<br>this, gaming or sports, then diet, you can create a channel<br>. Beauty in fashion can do. Can<br>do cooking. Can do comedy. Can do sports. Can<br>do fitness. Education can be channeled. can do. See this<br>is helping you so much. So you will<br>not be short of YouTube channel ideas. There is no shortage of YouTube content<br>. Now we talk. Last if you<br>want to enter your field. You can benefit from this free technology. Now,<br>when you come to the field of blogging, you know that you<br>have to write an article. After writing an article, you have to post it<br>, which is free, and you get traffic. Your<br>block is monetized by Adson, you get money for it, so you<br>can write<br>articles on your site with the help of it.<br>words ok yes you will write in this way it will<br>give you to write articles in a proper different way so now you have<br>to use this technology by using your mind and after using it you have to write<br>articles and your web It is to be published on the site<br>. See this. I have<br>asked it a question in a different way. It is giving me an answer in a different way. It is fine,<br>so you have to use it. Now I<br>will tell you how to do it next. Now you know that there are YouTubers, bloggers<br>, common man, students, if you are anyone,<br>how can you benefit from this technology. I am<br>going to show you how to use it. It<br>will be fine. See, I<br>asked him a question in a different way<br>. I copy the text from here and<br>check it so that you can be sure that it is a<br>unique text<br>. We also<br>randomly open the text here and see<br>how much is in our tax, so we<br>copied the tax here and after copying it, we<br>see how much it is. I am one hundred percent complete,<br>here is the check report and here is a<br>result, here is a result, here is my tax copy<br>here, here is a strong in, one hundred percent unique, the<br>whole text is unique, what do you want? Chat GPT has generated it,<br>see here. Chat GPT has generated it<br>. Now, what should you do next?

the go-to destination for<br>programming Health but before we dive<br>into the comparison let's take a moment<br>to explain what these two tools are and<br>how they differ chat gbt is a large<br>language model it uses state-of-the-art<br>machine learning algorithms to generate<br>human-like text allowing it to<br>understand and respond to a wide variety<br>of questions and prompts stack overflow<br>on the other hand is a website where<br>programmers can ask and answer questions<br>related to coding it's a Community<br>Driven platform where experienced users<br>provide answers to help other users<br>solve their problems the big news<br>recently is that stack Overflow has<br>banned the use of chat gbt in creating<br>answers to questions now that we have a<br>better understanding of these two tools<br>let's get started with the comparison<br>we're going to take some of the most<br>popular stack Overflow questions ask<br>chatgpt and can bear the results and in<br>case you were curious yes I did use chat<br>gbt to help me write the intro script to<br>this video so here I am on stack<br>Overflow and what I've done is just put<br>in python as my programming language of<br>choice and we're looking at some of the<br>most frequently asked questions this<br>first one is right up my alley we can<br>see the person is asking how to make<br>good reproducible pandas examples the<br>question they're asking is how to make<br>these examples when the data is more<br>complicated like if they have a date<br>time index or multi-index so I'm going<br>to go over here to chat GPT and just<br>copy and paste the whole question I'm<br>going to delete some of this but I'm<br>just going to hit enter<br>so we can see chat gbt is already<br>underway creating an answer to this<br>question it's actually writing some code<br>out and it's giving us some examples but<br>Does this answer actually make any sense<br>so the first part of this answer does<br>make sense it's telling us how to make<br>an example data frame the second part is<br>talking about using strings to answer<br>this so it's actually just saying to<br>make this code into a one long string so<br>what I'm going to do here is actually<br>run this code and see if it works one<br>issue that we're running across is this<br>code actually doesn't run it's using<br>this date range as an index which would<br>have 31 values and then the example data<br>frame only has three so anyone who knows<br>how to code would see this issue the<br>second part of the answer is talking<br>about using the data frames to string<br>method not only do I think this code<br>would not run but it doesn't really get<br>at the question that's being asked in<br>general it's getting some of the ideas<br>correct like using two dictionary method<br>would be sort of helpful in this<br>situation when trying to store off an<br>example data frame now let's compare<br>that to the actual stack Overflow answer<br>clearly people think this is a good<br>answer as 465 upvotes one thing that's<br>interesting about the stack Overflow<br>answer versus chat gbt is it actually<br>says things to avoid instead of just<br>answering the question directly and<br>there's a unique structure to how<br>they're answering it they're going<br>through a good way to do this a bad way<br>to do it and the Ugly so if someone was<br>asking me this question I would<br>definitely Point them towards this stack<br>Overflow link and not necessarily a chat<br>gbt answer now this second example is a<br>pretty standard stack Overflow question<br>this question is asking if you have<br>three variables like X Y or Z how do you<br>test if any of them are equal to a<br>certain value let's go ahead and copy<br>and paste this in its entirety into chat<br>gbt let's see what the answer is now<br>this answer looks a lot better it's<br>saying to use the in q word to test if<br>the value is in a list and then it also<br>gives an alternative answer where you<br>can use the any function to check if<br>these values are in the list that's not<br>a common way to approach this and<br>definitely the first way makes more<br>sense just to check this code in my<br>python interpreter and it does run this<br>is a good solution and answer it even<br>shows the inline comments which I don't<br>think were in the original question now<br>let's look at the stack Overflow answer<br>so this has over a thousand upvotes the<br>thing I like about this answer is it's<br>actually getting at the root of where<br>the person was thinking incorrectly they<br>show how in the question being asked<br>there's actually a misconception about<br>how python works so you can see here<br>they're putting this or statement after<br>X Y or Z this would actually just check<br>if Z equals zero it wouldn't be checking<br>all of them and this is something the<br>question askers can being confused by so<br>the stack Overflow answer does address<br>that misconception by the question asker<br>then they do go on to give the resulting<br>answer this isn't a full solution to<br>their exact problem but it's showing the<br>same thing that chat GPT came up with<br>which is that they could use the in<br>operator then the stack Overflow author<br>goes into a whole explanation as to<br>where the question Master got wrong so<br>I'd say for this one both chat gbt and<br>stack Overflow gave correct answers<br>there are some additional benefits to<br>how stack Overflow answered on the other<br>hand chat gbt did give a whole code<br>snippet that we could just paste in and<br>would work now the third and final stack<br>Overflow question we're going to look at<br>is about asking the user for input until<br>they give a valid response so it's clear<br>that this person wants to write some<br>code where It'll ask something like age<br>and if the user does not put in a<br>numeric value it'll keep asking the<br>question until it's correct so I did add<br>a little bit of context here to the<br>question about it being in Python and I<br>phrased it as a question<br>the answer that chat GPT comes up with<br>is to use a while loop with a try<br>exception clause in the result now this<br>is looks like a valid example and it<br>shows how it will break out of the loop<br>if you write the code like this it even<br>uses their exact example which is pretty<br>interesting of being voting age again<br>I'll paste this into a Jupiter notebook<br>see if the answer works so I'm going to<br>put a says it doesn't understand B uh<br>negative five sorry H cannot be negative<br>and if I put 21 it'll say I'm able to<br>vote if I put 10 this code does work and<br>it answers the question now let's go<br>back to stack Overflow and see what the<br>top answer is for this again we gotta<br>scroll down here and the answer is<br>pretty much the same and you can see<br>this person actually took it to a whole<br>nother level making additional checks<br>encapsulating everything as a function<br>this is a stellar human response but<br>also is kind of going beyond what was<br>asked in the question just a sanity<br>check let's go ahead and run this stack<br>Overflow answer and if we give it a it<br>says it must be integer so you could see<br>that it has some more checks in it<br>now this function they created is a<br>generic solution that would work for any<br>question and not necessarily just<br>specifically the question that was asked<br>chat gbt blows my mind it's amazing<br>technology and it can really help with<br>writing code but does it beat out stack<br>Overflow I think the jury's still out<br>and at least for these examples it looks<br>like there are some solutions that chat<br>gbt just can't match up to a human with<br>yet

first<br>of all what in the world is it and how<br>can you get started that's what we're<br>going to talk about so first of all what<br>is it well this is something coming from<br>the team from openai in chat GPT allows<br>you to optimize basically optimizing<br>language models for dialogue bottom line<br>it allows you to chat with AI and will<br>give you answers and it keeps getting<br>better and better right now it can allow<br>you to have follow-up questions it can<br>admit its mistakes and challenge<br>incorrect premises and it can reject<br>inappropriate requests as well so it's<br>it's pretty freaky you can talk to the<br>AI and we'll start giving you<br>um different answers now how to get how<br>do you get started and what are people<br>saying now not everyone's convinced<br>about this in fact some people are<br>saying I don't see the use case for chat<br>EPT way over hyped not useful Beyond<br>Chuckles will not change way of any of<br>us live that's from sweaty startups on<br>Twitter well we're going to take a look<br>at what you can be doing with chat GPT<br>and you can decide for yourself are you<br>going to be using it are you impressed<br>what are you going to do with it and<br>what kind of businesses can you create<br>with chat GPT so first of all if you go<br>to openai.com and you click to start<br>using chat GPT you can do that right at<br>the top right here you can say try now<br>it's going to ask you to sign in if you<br>don't have an account already you're<br>going to have to create one and then<br>you're going to be here at this prompt<br>now it's allowing you to understand the<br>examples that you can be doing with chat<br>GPT you can see the capabilities and<br>then also the limitations and I like<br>this because this allows you to<br>understand what you're in for right it's<br>not going to be overselling anything<br>let's take a look so number one you can<br>ask it anything for example explain<br>Quantum Computing in simple terms or get<br>creative ideas for a 10 year old's<br>birthday party I mean it's quite uh it's<br>quite a range now the capabilities<br>remember uh what users said earlier in<br>the conversation allow users to provide<br>follow-up Corrections train to decline<br>inappropriate requests so as you're<br>having the conversation it will change<br>over time now the limitations May<br>occasionally generate incorrect<br>information and still learning May<br>occasionally produce harmful<br>instructions or bias content and limited<br>knowledge of the world and events after<br>2021 okay so let's get started let's see<br>what it will do so I want to first see<br>explain Quantum Computing I'm going to<br>say that but I'm going to say explain it<br>to a 10 year old explain Quantum<br>Computing to a<br>um I'm gonna say a fifth grader fifth<br>grader if I can spell<br>what it says<br>now we'll say Quantum Computing is a<br>type of computing that uses tiny<br>particles called Quantum bits instead of<br>regular bits to perform calculations<br>that's interesting so it's uh breaking<br>it down I'm going to ask<br>give me<br>more details<br>if I can do that I can do a follow-up<br>sure to understand Quantum Computing<br>it's important to understand how regular<br>computers work okay so now it's giving<br>me more information and if you look at<br>this it's they're not using a lot of<br>huge words or anything like that it's<br>broken down now if I want to I can<br>I can say explain Quantum computing<br>to a I'm going to say college professor<br>or a college<br>now we're going to see what it looks<br>like<br>so it's thinking about its life hormone<br>okay<br>okay<br>so Quantum Computing is a type of<br>computing that uses the principles of<br>quantum mechanics to perform<br>calculations in contrast to classical<br>Computing which uses bits that can be<br>one of two states one zero or one<br>Quantum Computing so this one is clearly<br>a lot more detail the vocabulary has<br>changed because I'm telling it how to<br>talk to me<br>uh so that's just one example now say<br>for instance I put res uh reset thread<br>and I'm going to say<br>how did Logan Paul<br>get famous<br>and so here is breaking down who Logan<br>Paul is and how he had his breakout Fame<br>uh in just a few seconds and then it<br>allows me right here to say yes or no<br>was that a good response or was that not<br>a good response and really you can be<br>using this in so many different ways for<br>example in the same thread I mentioned<br>from sweaty startups uh shout out to<br>Steph Smith from a16z she mentions that<br>she could be using it for recipes<br>instead of dealing with all those<br>different recipe blogs with all the ads<br>she can just ask how to do certain<br>recipes and that's what GPT told her<br>what to do the instructions and<br>ingredients she wanted all of those<br>different things that's just one example<br>gpt3 uh well excuse me chat GPT is just<br>getting started and the more people are<br>going to be using it the better it's<br>going to be and in the future I see it<br>being used if you can start<br>controlling the modeling or having<br>professionals really model the<br>information this could help with mental<br>health uh Suicide Prevention those kind<br>of things and we see that actually in<br>the news what people are trying to do<br>with AI and chat GPT could be doing<br>those things as well if people are<br>interacting with that where they're<br>having daily check-ins and then if<br>something happens it can alert their<br>family or things like that there's a lot<br>of things that can be happening with uh<br>chat GPT and this is just the beginning<br>try it out create an account it's free<br>right now but I I'm pretty sure they're<br>going to start charging based on how<br>much people are you know searching and<br>everything like that but check it out<br>and if you have questions in the comment<br>section down below what are you going to<br>be using it for what kind of business do<br>you see using uh chat GPT for<br>um you know and we'll come back if you<br>like this kind of stuff we'll have

tell it to expand on this<br>point right here maybe open another tab<br>with chat GPT on it and say expand on<br>this and then you paste this segment<br>here or you could even say write a block<br>outline on making money online with<br>Shopify in 2022 and it will give you the<br>outline and then you could instruct chat<br>GPT to generate you the blog bit by bit<br>let's see what it gives us it gives you<br>the introduction definition of Shopify<br>and how it works potential for making<br>money online with Shopify store etc etc<br>etc and each element you will tell chat<br>GPT to expand on in other gigs later on<br>I might tell you to expand on it like<br>this so this is how you expand on things<br>so I don't want to go through it in each<br>and every element that I'm going to talk<br>about later on I just want to tell you<br>when I say expand on it this is how you<br>do it there are many other ways but this<br>is one of the ways so the next gig is<br>website content writer

information from what<br>I can see I don't know where it's<br>getting that information from it's doing<br>a good job obviously it's still in a<br>research phase might produce some errors<br>you have

property implications of<br>artificial intelligence content creation<br>the last week has gone crazy with chat<br>GPT being released<br>at the end of November<br>um I've been playing around with it a<br>lot and uh when you can get on it<br>because the system's been really busy<br>since so many people have signed up but<br>one of the as an intellectual property<br>lawyer of course our main concern is<br>always<br>is this you know infringing is it<br>creating intellectual property right so<br>I figured I'd give chat gbt<br>a test spin with answering that question<br>and writing a script so here is what it<br>spit out you know use of artificial<br>intelligence and the creation of content<br>grows sort of the questions surrounding<br>the ownership and control of such<br>content<br>in this video we explore some of the key<br>issues and considerations related to<br>intellectual property of AI generated<br>content first let's define what we mean<br>by a generated content this could<br>include anything from text to music to<br>art created with the help of AI tools<br>and algorithms some examples include<br>news articles written by an AI program<br>or a piece of music composed by an AI<br>system one of the main questions to run<br>an intellectual property of AI generated<br>content is who owns it is it the creator<br>of the AI system the person or interview<br>commission the content or the AI itself<br>but the answer to this question will<br>depend on the specific strokes and<br>stanzas and legal jurisdictions in which<br>the content was created in some cases<br>the creative AI system may be considered<br>the owner of the content it generates in<br>other cases the person or entity who<br>commissioned the content may be seen as<br>the owner there is currently for patents<br>a famous case uh Dr thaler I think his<br>machines called dabus dabus<br>and most jurisdictions have denied it<br>patentability because the machine is who<br>created The Invention but I believe<br>Australia or maybe one other country<br>might<br>have have<br>either either leaned into<br>granting it a patent still<br>um even though it was created by<br>Ai and then there's a lot of<br>implications that copyright office<br>specifically denied an application that<br>was for a image that was fully artwork<br>that was fully created AI now I don't<br>know if the AI you know if you're<br>prompting it and giving it prompts to<br>create it not just creating random art<br>on its own if if that might raise to the<br>level of creating it and that's actually<br>a little bit about what this post that<br>this created talks about you know there<br>are questions around potential for AI<br>General economy protected with copyright<br>in some cases<br>AI generated content may be seen as a<br>work for hire I mean the person or<br>entity commissioning that work for hire<br>is a specific type of<br>uh copyright ownership transfer<br>essentially if you have an employee it's<br>considered work for hire or if you have<br>a specific agreement for specific types<br>of works it's considered a work for hire<br>and it's essentially as if the entity<br>that the person is working for<br>created it ultimate the intellectual<br>property implications AI generating<br>content is still largely Uncharted<br>Territory it will likely be up to quarts<br>and lawmakers to establish how these<br>issues are addressed<br>so what I was really going for here and<br>maybe it was the prompt I used was to<br>see<br>the input the intellectual property<br>implications of the content that the AI<br>is using to create new content whether<br>it's images whether it's<br>written words uh<br>what are those implications from a<br>infringement aspect so<br>does<br>AI generated<br>content<br>another's copyright let's see how it<br>handles this question<br>interchange<br>it's thinking<br>it is possible for AI generated content<br>to infringe on another copyright that<br>could occur if the AI generated content<br>uses reproduces or derives a notice<br>copyright work without permission to<br>copyright owner for example if an AI<br>system is trained on a data set that<br>includes copyrighted content and the AI<br>then generates new content that<br>incorporates element of a copyrighted<br>content and could possibly be seen as<br>infringing on the original copyright<br>so far that sounds correct<br>in order to avoid copyright infringement<br>is important for creators AI generated<br>content to ensure they have necessary<br>permissions and license in place before<br>using any copyrighted material it's part<br>of the AI training or creation process<br>additionally it's important to keep in<br>mind that even if the AI system itself<br>is generating the content the person or<br>entity using the AI may still be held<br>responsible for the copyright<br>infringement that's that's the big<br>concern so if you're planning to use AI<br>in the creation of content it's<br>important to be aware of these issues<br>and seek legal audience as needed<br>ensure that you're not infringing on the<br>others rights so<br>I like that because that is true it's<br>going to depend upon what you use<br>to train the system whether it's actual<br>AI or machine learning but it's just<br>interesting because as humans we learn<br>we read copyrighted content<br>so we're getting things all over whether<br>it's listening to music seeing pictures<br>watching videos yeah everything that<br>we're getting is coming from generally<br>copyrighted content which is probably<br>where the AI will get it from two so<br>it's just<br>it's going to be interesting to see how<br>it plays out in the future if you

In<br>the morning , I released a video<br>chat GPT registration .<br>Since there are many people playing this project, it<br>is relatively popular,<br>but<br>it is still not convenient for us to log in to the web version at any time<br>. So<br>we thought of saying<br>that this chatGDP It is not so convenient to connect to our WeChat QQ<br>through some API methods , because<br>WeChat has been stopped on a large scale<br>. This is called the WeChat web version,<br>which means that<br>your WeChat cannot log in to the web version<br>. You cannot use this<br>chat GPD<br>. Today I will make a tutorial for you that<br>connects chat GPT to telegram. We chat with<br> <br>this robot. In fact, the background support of this robot<br>is chat GDP , that is,<br>we can<br>have a conversation<br>with this artificial intelligence without using the web version.<br>Well<br> <br>, let’s start directly without talking nonsense.<br>First of all , the project we came to is called chat GDP telegram.<br>This project has not been around for a long time<br>, only a few days<br>, but its star is already 1,600. There<br>are still quite a lot of people using it.<br>At the same time , it is also an open source project.<br>Let’s take a brief look at<br>it. First, we need to download its code<br>, then create a robot<br>, modify some configurations<br>, set the user<br>, and then execute the program.<br>Well , we will start from scratch<br>. The first step It is to upload<br>files on our VPS. We first go to its download page<br>. There are several download codes here<br>. Then you need to download according to your own system.<br>Here<br>is windows,<br>these two are Linux,<br>these two are macos<br>and I use Linux<br>, but here you can see that it distinguishes amd<br>and ARM architectures.<br>I am using ARM64 bits now<br>, so I will download this. Well<br>, it will take a while to download<br>. Let’s connect to the server and I<br>will upload the file directly<br>. After decompressing it,<br>modify a shorter file name<br>, and then upload this folder directly to the root directory of the<br>remote server<br>. If we configure it, we need to look back.<br>First , we want to create a robot<br>. Then we go to telegram and<br>@ botfather<br>and then Click here to start<br>creating a robot<br>. The command we use is new bot.<br>We now need a name. For a<br>robot , there must be an<br>underscore<br>and then add bot. Oh, the name<br>bot<br>is also taken<br>. It seems that this name can be used<br>, which means that we are creating a robot name. At the time,<br>first of all , we need a name plus the line bot<br>, and then the API is given here.<br>We will use it later<br>, and then we have to go<br>here to get our user ID,<br>and we can give this user info casually. The bot sends a message and<br>it returns the ID of the TG account I'm currently using<br>. Let's copy it first<br>and then go here<br>and we enter the upload just now.<br>Then vim this file,<br>I install this command, wait a minute,<br>what we want to edit is this one<br>, the first one is the telegram ID,<br>click i<br>to enter the edit mode<br>, and then we fill in my own ID just obtained here<br>, then this<br>In fact, the ID<br>is the user, who has the authority to chat with this robot<br>. It supports multiple users here<br>, that is, you can separate them with commas<br>, and the token is the token of our robot.<br>We copy this long string and put it in<br> <br>After<br>writing here, the following line<br>means that the waiting time is 1 second,<br>so we can save it directly . After saving, we need to<br>change the name of this file.<br>We use<br>the cp<br>command<br>to rename<br>it to . Come down and let’s see what we need to do.<br>Here , everyone, pay attention to the fact that<br>our remote server<br>does<br> <br>not have a browser installed, but he later said that he wants to<br>start this browser. Put it in a file, enter<br>this directory<br>, and then it has a file,<br>we put the<br>cookie directly here, if<br>there is no such directory, then we create one<br>, and then we CD into it<br>, it seems that this file must not exist<br>, we directly copy its file name<br>and then Edit it.<br>Its<br>format is like this<br>. It is a curly bracket. The content<br>there . We need to replace the cookie here.<br>How to get this cookie?<br>We first need to log in to<br>the chat GPT on this machine, then press F12<br>F12 and click Apply here There are cookies,<br>and then we choose chat open ai.<br>The top one is our token<br>, and when copying, it is from the top.<br>Let’s<br>start from the bottom. Let’s copy from the bottom, copy<br>completely<br>, and fill in the two quotation marks<br>to put<br>the whole<br>Copy the content<br>and then<br>fill it into this file<br>and paste it.<br>Look<br>at the format and there is no problem<br>.

To those who don't know,<br>we can type in the words we want, search, and make things work. We can<br>write codes.

This way, and<br>the more specific the command, the better<br>. It's amazing. If you write and speak<br>English well, you don't need a translator. And Korean is also available, so<br>try it<br>in Korean.<br>The code is complete. Then you can copy it<br>here . Buttons come out<br>But this really<br>comes out numbers one by one This means this is<br>chatting<br>You can ask me to<br>edit it after<br>this<br>. We 've done it this way, because<br>we can easily modify it, or you can just give it a command.<br>Now, since it's complete, copy it<br>, delete the original one, paste it, and<br>run it again. It changed to pick out six numbers.<br>But this is a command through chatting,<br>so we add to this, change the font size, change the screen<br>size, etc. It's possible<br>. And while doing<br>this, you can change it now . In<br>the same case, a function enters and comes out<br>, but sometimes a<br>class is created and inserted, and sometimes the number<br>is output vertically. It's<br>different every time. I like it And if<br>you want to do it completely differently, you can do<br>it by clicking here New Chat<br>. Can I do it ?<br>You'll think about<br>this too.

about what this<br>is and how you can start finding<br>business ideas to enter this space first<br>of all what is lensa well lensa is a<br>platform where you can start making AI<br>images of yourself and they look pretty<br>great if you look around the internet<br>people are doing this all over the place<br>celebrities of all types are making<br>these different AI uh these photos and<br>because of this uh this this company is<br>crushing it but this is a bigger Trend<br>with AI and what's going on for example<br>with openai they have stuff with Chachi<br>TP who just crossed over a million users<br>in less than five days all of these<br>things are speaking to a larger trends<br>that people are making serious money<br>serious businesses using this technology<br>so how could you start capitalizing on<br>chat GPT that just got really least and<br>there's a link down below to know more<br>about that or even looking at AI where<br>do something with images uh what we see<br>over here with lensa what could you do<br>well if I'm looking at something like<br>chat GTP where I could be asking a<br>platform questions and then it's giving<br>me answers and it's giving me content I<br>would be looking at five different key<br>areas and I would just look on Fiverr to<br>start getting started of what I possibly<br>could do for example<br>number one copywriting I just typed in<br>copywriting right here I see copywriting<br>emails social media copywriter landing<br>pages sales page copywriter copywriting<br>for websites so if I'm getting started<br>in the space I would go on upwork or<br>Fiverr say that I can write copy for one<br>of these specific things say for<br>instance copyright emailing emails and<br>then I would use the prompts from<br>chatgpt to get copy get the writing to<br>start writing these email sequences now<br>you can use chat GTP to ask it any<br>questions or you could say create me a<br>headline for and then you could do your<br>target audience and then it could write<br>the headline so the the subject line of<br>the email and then you can ask it to<br>create five bullet points about you know<br>a need for a certain industry you can do<br>all that things those things with chat<br>GTP so again I would look at Fiverr look<br>at the packages what people are charging<br>and then I would just go and start<br>creating a service based off those<br>things so that's just copywriting I<br>would do the same thing with marketing<br>ads if I was a consultant say for<br>instance they wanted me to start<br>brainstorming names of a company or<br>names of a product I would use chat GTP<br>and I would also use it if I'm trying to<br>create different guides say for instance<br>if I'm trying to make different recipe<br>guides if I'm trying to explain how to<br>do something say for instance knitting<br>quilting anything that took step-by-step<br>instructions I would need you can use<br>that all with chat GTP very easily that<br>that's all right there but open AI<br>doesn't just have that they also created<br>whisper in dolly<br>uh Dolly allows you to create realistic<br>images just by typing in a few different<br>words so just like right here astronaut<br>riding a horse and then a photorealistic<br>style I can change that teddy bear<br>mixing sprinkle chemicals as a mad<br>scientist as a 1990s Saturday morning<br>cartoon right or or digital art so you<br>can see how it changes there's a lot of<br>things that you can be doing with Dolly<br>as well so if I'm trying to create<br>different uh stock images I could be<br>doing this and shout out to uh Mark<br>Fletcher that's doing that with a with a<br>platform that he just created I could do<br>that with openai or something that just<br>came out as well whisper that allows you<br>to have accuracy on English speech<br>recognition so uh transcription so you<br>could be making your own transcription<br>company uh if you're transcribing<br>podcasts for people so that's another<br>service that you could be doing you<br>could be uh you could be offering to<br>have all the transcriptions done for<br>someone's podcast so it makes it into<br>blog posts as well so as you can see<br>there's a lot of different things that<br>you could be doing with uh Chachi TP<br>what's going on with AI in general in<br>the comment section down below let me<br>know what you think about these ideas if<br>you have more questions and if you like<br>these kind of videos again if you have<br>more questions we'll be doing more about<br>Ai and what's happening and again if you<br>like this

I will give you all the information to try this<br>truly mind-blowing stuff and above all we will try to answer the question:<br>will we all lose our jobs because of robots in the next three years ?<br>Good morning everyone here is Dany your trusted engineer and today we talk about GPT 3 chat And I<br>assure you that it could put at risk so many jobs that are<br>done by us today! Let's talk about a product that has been released to the public by a company that you<br>surely know is called Open AI! This company is<br>all about doing AI research and their ultimate goal is to build the<br>perfect AI one way or another! Well it seems that they have almost succeeded because<br>we have some really absurd stuff in front of us! But let's start from the basics GPT is a model that<br>has already existed on the internet for a long time: it is a linguistic model that, starting from your keys<br>typed on a keyboard, is able to interpret in a frighteningly accurate way what you<br>are saying to it. In technical jargon this stuff is called a natural language processor and is<br>capable of doing a lot of really crazy things! It can give you financial advice,<br>generate code, starting from a text, create a speech for you to give in front of hundreds of people,<br>write essays, do your math homework... That is, it can literally do everything! Chat GPT<br>, on the other hand, is basically the same thing, however it is combined with a robot that is able to give you<br>answers within a trend or a context! Oh well I won't bore you,<br>let's go try it and look at what incredible stuff they've invented then we all start shaking<br>because we'll lose our jobs.. (we don't want to be conspiracy theorists let's go!) And here we are with<br>incognito navigation! Let's type as URL beta.openai.com Dear, moreover, if you want<br>to support the channel completely free of charge, I remind you right now to leave<br>a nice like and subscribe! Likes are free And in short, they help me a lot with my work...<br>I bring you some interesting content as you can see! You will find yourself In front of this wonderful<br>screen you can explore projects. There are tutorials. We are interested in the GPT chat<br>that we find above where we will click try it. Click and another page will open where<br>we will have to log in or create our own account. So create an account it will ask you to send the<br>confirmation message to your mobile too, do it and then we'll see you on the final screen.<br>Ok guys here we are here in front of us we have GPT chat Here are some examples of the<br>capabilities and some limitations that actually the dev team put in to avoid<br>hurting someone. For example, why don't we get explained how a<br>quantum computer works in simple words? Let's go below, let's send it and look at that stuff! I mean I... I<br>When I see these things they are... in five lines guys! A BOT trained on textual data<br>was able to explain to a person like me how quantum computing works! \"<br>Quantum computing is a type of computation that uses quantum mechanical phenomena here explains the theory<br>of zeros of 1s and the fact that Bits can assume the state of 01 at the same time\" I<br>am hallucinated.. Let's explore again because there are a lot of things to be seen! Let's try to put him<br>in the ballpark: let's ask him What is the smartest way to invest today? Let's do the<br>research Wow Look how he manages to extract from such a complicated question a context that<br>actually makes sense! He answers \"There is no single answer to this question because the<br>best way to invest depends on your individual circumstances financial goals.\" Me<br>guys... This stuff is literally the computer revolution as<br>we know it! That is, today you can imagine How many jobs can actually explode because of this<br>Bot! It's incredible! But then the potential is by no means finished! Look how cool!<br>I'll show you this now: Let's go the hard way \"Generate Java code to place<br>10 items in a shopping cart\". Let's see if you can do it! Here is an example of<br>code... that is, guys, he created the main he created the cart list called cart he did the<br>for loop... that is You can imagine how much time a tool like this can save a developer<br>! I don't even have to open Visual studio eclipse... It does everything! The crazy thing guys<br>is that you can keep talking in this discussion! For example \"more items\" then more<br>items. Here is an updated version of the code that instead of adding 10 you add 20!<br>I can not describe ... ie this thing is real! No because right now I feel like I'm<br>living in a sci-fi movie! It's really absurd! Now I need some<br>creative ideas because it's my girlfriend's engagement anniversary... Let 's see<br>what she replies. I don't have these needs though. Here are some ideas for creating<br>your anniversary gift! That is, here he is recommending the jewels, the rings or<br>the necklace! She advises us to look at her hobbies or interests that she is passionate about<br>: hot air balloon rides... sentimental road: by creating a photo album! Let's also test<br>his knowledge from a historical point of view: let's ask him Who was the<br>president in Italy in 1985? So this time we don't ask for advice but let's<br>ask a specific question. \"In 1985 the Italian president was Sandro Pertini he was<br>the seventh Italian president and enslaved since 78 About 85 he was a member of the Socialist Party\" Oh<br>well And here's the whole story. We ask for more information \"Give me more information Please\"<br>We are also polite. No, luckily I don't have access to any additional information. Interesting!<br>So it actually has some limitations! It is a universal knowledge of the world but it<br>has some limits! But already so I'm appalled. Now let's throw ourselves completely into science fiction:<br>ask him if he has a conscience! GPT model do you have a conscience? \"I'm a large<br>openhai trained speech model I'm not capable of being sentient or conscious I'm just a<br>program that processes text and a response is based on input I have no thinking or feeling<br>and I exist only to help you answer questions and provide information\". I<br>absolutely wanted to ask him this : let's ask him if he thinks we are alone in the universe. If you want to activate<br>Italian, just click on the translator. \"There is no definitive answer to this question.<br>Some people believe there are other intelligent life within the universe while<br>others believe we are alone. The truth is, we just don't know for sure. There is a<br>vast Universe out there out the possibilities that another form of intelligent life exists cannot be<br>ruled out, however until we have hard evidence of such life we ​​can only speculate.\" I<br>am truly shocked at the progress this company has made on artificial intelligence!<br>When I was studying during my master's degree because I specialized in this<br>stuff, there were no models as well made as this one! I can assure you that while<br>few are talking about it right now this deal here will completely revolutionize<br>the way work is viewed today! It's fair to say guys though that these models<br>aren't 100% accurate, they actually make several mistakes and make several<br>inaccuracies. So you can definitely rest assured you won't get fired starting<br>tomorrow. But it is actually a very useful tool that allows us to help solve<br>problems, to obtain information in a very fast way. And so<br>what do you think? I'll wait for you in the comments let's discuss this wonderful technology<br>and all the implications it could have in everyday life see you soon [Music]</td></tr><tr><td>410MlGSGOtw</td><td>Transcript could not be fetched</td></tr><tr><td>BODu-q2E01s</td><td>Peace be upon you. Regarding chatgpt artificial intelligence,<br>how do you use it in Algeria and other Arab countries that are prohibited from entering it?<br>You need three things vpn and this special application to get a Polish number and<br>thus get the activation code. Also, the website<br>for this service, and this is where we enter. There are some<br>videos I put before to get to this place that you can go back<br>to and watch. First, upon registration, you can register with an e-mail<br>through your Google account or through your Microsoft account.<br>Before that, we enter to obtain a number before activating the vpn. When activating<br>this application, it does not work well. Also, the application is somewhat prohibited<br>in, uh, when going to the Play Store. And search for As we watch,<br>you can get it in Google, search for it in Google, you will find the application<br>or a link under the video in the YouTube channel. Before activating<br>get a number first. Here we are going to enter it. Interface<br>This is my account with which I activated my account. And the numbers you got<br>. I can now get a third number. You will find registration through your<br>Google account as well. So you reach this interface. Here, there are no these<br>numbers. By clicking on this interface, here you enter a number,<br>you can own three numbers in this application. Here you choose a<br>random name, color that number you want, then enter<br>. Now you take that number is<br>forty-eight plus where do we need it? We are now activating this. It is better to<br>use it<br>, then activate it from the bottom. Thus, now the key appeared at the top. It works. We return<br>to the site<br>. This is the site. Now we are registering, as I said, by registering with a<br>number or your Google account. This time I'm going to try my Microsoft account because I'm<br>already registered with Google.<br>Choose the account. we wait. Here you enter your name, then here is a number, as<br>I said, we have a number, so if we go to<br>Zaid, it starts with forty-eight. We go back to those numbers. So AA memorizes<br>and writes them . four five nine<br>Four five nine we return zero sixty nine<br>zero sixty nine and another number ah telematics fifty four.<br>Tamilism and fifty-four cents. If there is no problem now, the<br>number has been sent. He will arrive here. The first time I tried this number, it didn't work. But<br>the second one reached me, and it arrives in this way, as we see in the language. And this is the code<br>you activated, uh, that account. I logged into my account normally.<br>We will try, for example, another number to confirm well. We try the new one and see if it works<br>well because I activated it so I have to stop and then go back to<br>the application. he is working well. This is I will add a new number. The number is activated<br>. I got a message here. This is an activation message for the first number. It arrived<br>late, but it arrived as we saw. It is a massage. As we see, we will<br>take it. See if we can go to one hundred and seventy-four zero zero seven.<br>One hundred<br>seventy four zero zero seven. I hope he gets in.<br>I will do you disable we will try maybe the method will work. If I reactivate<br>again.<br>answers.<br>If the login is successful now, as we can see, and I can use it directly<br>now, it works well. For example, I will try any question. I want the story of a<br>wild rabbit in a mountain. In the cold winter. You can write whatever you want and<br>he will answer you. Wait as I watched now the answer. Well, I'll give you<br>a mowing on a winter's mountain. It was a cold winter in a mountain at<br>the end of November, and the days were short, which means he is writing that<br>novel to the end. You can use this AI<br>to write novels and more. As watched as if someone is writing.<br>Honestly, it's more than wonderful. I hope that the explanation is simple, and if you find<br>it difficult to write a comment, I will answer it. Thanks for following.

dead now but Jasper<br>team must do something and I think that<br>what they launched last week is<br>something to compete with cha GPT even a<br>stack over a flow ban charging PT all<br>these signals should make you think<br>about the power of this AI platform and<br>how can affect you your skills your job<br>your business your website<br>even Google make it affect my opinion<br>people will go towards searching for<br>things using AI instead of searching the<br>web randomly trying to find a solution<br>for their problem let me give you a<br>practical example let's say our<br>programmer and you want to write a<br>script that achieves a certain task<br>instead of searching for 5 10 or 30<br>minutes on Google to find the correct<br>answer you can simply use chargpt and in<br>less than 10 seconds it will write the<br>script for you did you know why I am<br>worried and why you should of course if<br>you care about your future and your kids<br>your family and your skill and your job<br>at least you have to understand how<br>these Technologies work and how to deal<br>with to be aware of<br>so let me share with you my plan how I<br>will revive my website and my business<br>how to deal with such Technologies my<br>formula that we can use whenever you<br>plan for your job your skills your<br>freelancing career your website your<br>business anything whatever you're<br>planning to do in the future just keep<br>this formula in your mind the s-c-e-d<br>polygon formula s stands for styling<br>charging PT can never take over your own<br>style and your own presentation so make<br>sure to work on your own style if you're<br>a writer if you are a YouTuber whatever<br>you are just make sure to make a unique<br>style that charging PT can never<br>replicate C stands for Community make<br>sure to build audience and a community<br>real human beings communicating with<br>each other in a specific Niche this<br>would be very important in the near<br>future people will love to share their<br>thoughts with real human beings instead<br>of robots so build a community and your<br>Niche a stands for experience charging<br>PT can generate everything but it can<br>never generate your own experience so<br>make sure whenever you are creating<br>content or doing anything make sure to<br>put your experience in this thing and<br>last but not least and I think it's the<br>most important D for data focus on<br>collecting data the example I mentioned<br>for with IQ can work with anything for<br>example in my case I mentioned before I<br>am collecting Google serve data hundreds<br>of thousands of results and then<br>analyzing them to understand how Google<br>works then I can create a new SEO<br>strategies that are data driven based on<br>real data I think data is the power for<br>the future your own data so start<br>collecting data whatever Niche you are<br>in collect data analyze it and share<br>Real Results Based on data if you want<br>to learn more about this data study that<br>I am learning more about charging PT and<br>all this stuff and if you want to<br>download and get this data for free and<br>what I'm doing you can check this blog<br>post I

then<br>you're going to be brought to a screen<br>that looks something like this this is<br>the main home screen as it is right now<br>I know that there working on upgrading<br>things and scaling things up so this may<br>have changed when you're watching this<br>video but for now this is what it looks<br>like and what I want you to pay<br>attention to is the First Column there<br>which is examples just to kind of give<br>you an idea as to how to start using it<br>what types of prompts you can type in to<br>get the AI to start working for you and<br>then I also want you to take note of the<br>limitations note that it says that it<br>may occasionally generate incorrect<br>information or it may occasionally<br>produce harmful instructions or biased<br>content now I'm pointing this out<br>because it's important that you don't<br>just type things in and get information<br>back from the AI and take it without<br>vetting it yourself not only is this<br>important because it may be incorrect<br>harmful or biased but this is also<br>important because you still want your<br>content to be authentically you to come<br>from you so it's important that you take<br>what it gives you but then turn it into<br>your own content with your own value<br>your own expertise your own stories<br>examples from working with clients<br>whatever you want to inject into the<br>content to make it yours you might also<br>get information back from the AI that<br>doesn't quite fit your philosophy of<br>things or you may not agree with certain<br>things so make sure that you're always<br>vetting whatever you get from this app<br>so now let's talk about how to actually<br>use it so you'll see at the bottom of<br>the screen there's a blinking cursor<br>there that is where you're going to type<br>in your first prompt or your question to<br>get an answer back from the AI so I'm<br>going to show you an example let's say<br>that I'm a money coach and I want to<br>help my clients develop an abundance<br>mindset start thinking generally maybe<br>we just want to start with what is an<br>abundance mindset so I type that in and<br>this is the paragraph that I got back an<br>abundance mindset is the belief that<br>there is enough for everyone and that<br>abundance rather than scarcity is the<br>natural state of things this type of<br>mindset typically leads people to be<br>more generous and willing to share with<br>others and to be more focused on growth<br>and abundance in their own lives it is<br>the opposite of a scarcity mindset which<br>is based on the belief that there is<br>never enough and that resources are<br>limited so if I was creating a YouTube<br>video a podcast episode a blog post this<br>could be a really strong intro for me I<br>might want to add something at the very<br>very beginning as sort of a hook to draw<br>people in before I get into the more<br>nitty-gritty definition stuff but this<br>is at least getting my mind working<br>instead of me staring at a blank screen<br>trying to come up with something from<br>scratch or Googling things and kind of<br>piecing things together the difference<br>is that the AI software actually puts<br>things together in a more gelled format<br>so that it starts to actually feel like<br>a more cohesive piece of content now the<br>next thing that I'm going to do is I'm<br>going to think about okay I've told them<br>what an abundance mindset is how do you<br>actually cultivate an abundance mindset<br>this is the actual value part of it so<br>we go from having the hook to having an<br>intro now we have value that we want to<br>give and so we usually want to give like<br>points or tips so I typed in how do you<br>cultivate an abundance mindset and I got<br>that five different tips there are<br>several ways to cultivate an abundance<br>mindset and then a practice gratitude<br>take care of yourself be open to new<br>experiences and opportunities be<br>generous and visualize abundance along<br>with a little description of each so I<br>can go ahead now and flesh those out of<br>course if I agree with them I can add<br>some others tweak it as needed but let's<br>say I was really happy with this I can<br>go in and flesh it out what I want to<br>add again is my value my unique opinions<br>my experiences maybe stories from<br>working with clients or my own stories<br>to really make it my own because that is<br>where we really provide value for our<br>clients that's how we attract our ideal<br>clients is injecting our own<br>authenticity our own take on things not<br>just taking this and copy pasting it now<br>after we give the value we might want to<br>wrap up with some sort of conclusion so<br>what I typed in is why is an abundance<br>mindset important and I got a pretty<br>good conclusion here you can pause the<br>screen to see what the whole thing says<br>but it's not like a very good wrap up<br>even down to the last sentence here<br>which says overall an abundance mindset<br>can help you lead a happier more<br>fulfilling life and to create abundance<br>in all areas of your life now again<br>going back to the example I'm a money<br>coach so I might want to draw that back<br>to money and building Financial wealth<br>or generational wealth or whatever it is<br>that my ideal clients are seeking to do<br>but again I have a framework here that I<br>can now create longer YouTube video I<br>can create a podcast episode a blog post<br>or if I wanted to just really condense<br>it and keep it short I can create an<br>Instagram caption I can create a Twitter<br>thread based on the five different<br>points that are here or I could even go<br>back to one of these points and even one<br>of these could become a piece of<br>Instagram content that I can flesh out<br>but you can see that this app is really<br>just giving me the ability to get my<br>juices flowing and really get into<br>things without again staring at a blank<br>piece of paper or a blank cursor on my<br>computer and trying to think of<br>everything from scratch remember that<br>your specific expertise your opinions<br>your beliefs your work with your clients<br>that is what is going to actually set<br>you apart because anybody can Google<br>something and anybody can piece things<br>together from things that they found on<br>the internet which is essentially what<br>this AI is doing but people need to hear<br>from you they want to hear your unique<br>take so make sure you're injecting that<br>throughout and making sure that you're<br>making this content your own and take it<br>and run with it so give this a try let<br>me know how it goes let me know in the<br>comments what do you think about using<br>AI do you feel weird about it at all are<br>you excited about it could you see the<br>value of it could you see that it could<br>save time or is it something that you're<br>just you know what I'd rather just go<br>back and just create my content my old<br>way let me know in the comments below<br>this is such an interesting conversation<br>make sure you subscribe so that you get<br>my future videos and I will see you in<br>the next

know<br>it's not as good<br>like let me get my I had to find the<br>cable to plug my phone in so I can have<br>chat up my phone oh I came with my new<br>airpods I got new airpods and they're<br>they're fire bro<br>um<br>I don't know why it's red on here Red's<br>gotta mean something<br>fresh new lightning cable love the smell<br>of crispy Cable in the morning<br>let's go uh yeah we trust this computer<br>now we don't trust shit all right I'm<br>good<br>um<br>my channel<br>hello<br>hi everyone hey uh morning okay<br>good we got Chad over here we got we got<br>the mobile streaming set up today<br>because we're in shitty San Francisco<br>welcome to shitty San Francisco where<br>everything's shitty and I'm scared to go<br>outside uh no I'm really I'm in San<br>Diego I miss Alex and I do have a nice<br>cup of tea though so that's that's like<br>a nice guy we're gonna we're gonna we're<br>gonna sip t<br>um and we're gonna do Advent of code but<br>I'm gonna have any code this year I've<br>been very busy you know you got to be a<br>hardcore engineer if you want to make it<br>at elon's Twitter<br>uh so you know we've been a hardcore<br>uh<br>and I'm still terrible at Scala so you<br>know you guys can all make fun of me<br>hang on we got we gotta we gotta we<br>gotta turn on we gotta disable auto lock<br>for our luck<br>never okay<br>um what are my plans for today uh well<br>my friend just got sideswiped so you<br>know uh he's gonna deal with that it's<br>annoying uh<br>no plans man no plans I got a dinner<br>tomorrow<br>group house you know<br>of course<br>you know it's just like these people are<br>running it all back these people are<br>running back the same shitty culture<br>that got Tech to where it is today man<br>moved to San Diego chill make our<br>Technologies are<br>um<br>is Scala only a framework for<br>microservices no Scala is a full<br>programming language based on the jvm<br>okay so let's Scala<br>all right so this is my input uh<br>I copied the cookie into Chrome<br>okay we have to figure out the elf<br>carrying the most calories<br>so let's go what should I call it what<br>should I call it Go dot Scala okay Scala<br>read file<br>all right all right fine<br>uh oh I can't log in<br>oh oh that's annoying hang on I gotta<br>hide the let me hide<br>this<br>no this while I log in to open Ai and we<br>can use chat EBT to help us out<br>all right that will that make everyone<br>happy if we use chat GPT<br>was it chat.openai.com<br>log in with your openai account<br>okay I<br>this is a research preview<br>okay I can bring that back all right<br>we're good we go we go very good all<br>right let's make this a little smaller<br>all right all right<br>um<br>how do I read a file in Scala<br>this looks pretty nice<br>I do not care at all about the ball game<br>Scala go.com<br>print Ln lines should I do this in a<br>wrap up<br>illegal start of top level definition<br>longer explanation available when<br>compiling with explained do I need a<br>main method<br>that was useless<br>um<br>Scala illegal start of top<br>inside another definition<br>what<br>what am I doing wrong guys<br>the main method is an entry point into<br>scholar<br>wait I can just make anything main if I<br>do at Main<br>does that work<br>all right we read some we read some<br>stuff in Scala<br>um<br>they end up with the following list so<br>there's going to be some empty ones that<br>seems good<br>yeah I'm sure we could copy it from chat<br>gbt but uh also that's where I am so we<br>have to move me hang on<br>I'm going to be using over there so<br>we'll put me down here<br>now we'll put me up here I'm small<br>no but that's a waste of okay right<br>there maybe his best okay<br>okay<br>um<br>get lines to list all right we have to<br>we have to find the empty lines<br>wow this is so bad I'm so bad at Scala<br>boys string to in Scala<br>uh we could do map<br>X<br>all right VAR nums no but this doesn't<br>work because we have to separate it<br>based on the elves<br>oh this is hard<br>this is hard uh<br>there's a partition function in Scala<br>no it only returns two that's not gonna<br>work<br>I'm going to split sequences into<br>subsets ah Group by okay let's try that<br>split at<br>no I'm not in the Twitter bedrooms I<br>have an apartment I'm not a Savage all<br>right no that's not what I want I don't<br>want to split at no never mind<br>uh Group by<br>I really just want the type<br>no that's not what I want either<br>split at<br>groups two<br>oh you see what I'm trying to do why is<br>it so hard<br>okay we could recursively partition<br>a partition that returns a list of lists<br>okay let's try lines dot partition<br>we need a function that returns a<br>Boolean<br>actually I think I can just do this<br>uh and we'll say about<br>F God<br>so wait oh is it so that actually does<br>not work at all I think it's dot I think<br>it's that to access a single one<br>okay never mind partition did not do<br>what I wanted<br>um<br>all right all right you get subscriber<br>only chat that's right Lana Lux thank<br>you for the raid good to see you well<br>we'll let non-subscribers talk in honor<br>of<br>of of of Lana lux's raid<br>um<br>guys I'm really bad at Scala like<br>Twitter should fire me you know<br>who thinks Twitter should fire me<br>okay Group by<br>split at partition<br>[Music]<br>no this isn't what I want okay<br>maybe we don't want to get lines maybe<br>we first want to how do I split Scala<br>split<br>this split available on Scala and Java<br>string objects<br>so where's my chat GPT that told me how<br>to read a file<br>so maybe instead of make lines we'll do<br>make string<br>and then we'll do<br>dot split that<br>what is that going to return that's not<br>going to return a list of oh it is going<br>to return a list of strings okay we'll<br>call it animals<br>found array string required list what's<br>the difference Scala that's as Chachi if<br>you take Scott what's<br>that difference<br>between Scala array and Scholar list I<br>think one's mutable and one's not<br>eraser mutable okay good<br>okay great we get an L Java Lang string<br>great uh you gotta love oh man don't you<br>love Java no okay uh I think it's l Sub<br>Zero will get me the first elf<br>okay cool<br>okay and now we can do elves.map<br>we're going to map by the way if you're<br>calling something in Scala that only has<br>one argument you don't need a<br>parentheses thing<br>so let's do split n dot map<br>uh two inch<br>I think that's right<br>Okay now what's the type going to be uh<br>the type is going to be<br>array array it<br>elves two<br>I found two int<br>okay Scala to int<br>how do I convert a string to an integer<br>oh it has to be an argument so I think I<br>can say<br>da<br>okay good<br>uh now of course I don't want to raise I<br>want lists<br>um can I say that that'll give me the<br>first one<br>okay good now we're in our place ready<br>to solve this<br>um<br>they like to know how many calories is<br>being carried by the elf carrying the<br>most calories bro if I had to actually<br>do this I'd be fucked right now do<br>people solve this in like 30 seconds<br>we'll call this elves stir and we'll<br>call this elves because we it's<br>important to use good names we'll call<br>this elves strength because that's a<br>very Java looking thing right<br>I don't know I'm not a Java programmer<br>okay<br>um actually we want some so there's got<br>to be a way to just sum them<br>okay we've read in the stuff<br>now we can say elves dot map<br>um array sum Scala<br>oh it's a list Method All right well<br>let's hope it's uh let's map<br>dot sum<br>elf total Gray<br>all right let's just go for this is<br>there a Max method<br>there's some chance that just works<br>great<br>just the right answer<br>let's try it<br>uh most calories how much calories<br>that's the right answer I'm one gold<br>star okay<br>um might have run out of snacks by the<br>top three<br>okay the top three elves the sum of the<br>calories of the top three okay so we<br>can't use max anymore<br>we need to sort<br>Scala sort<br>uh<br>sorted now we need a slice<br>um Scala list slice<br>great from index until index so let's<br>try slice zero two I don't know if<br>that's inclusive because we actually<br>need three is that going to give me<br>three great it's gonna be bullshit all<br>right cool let's check the length of<br>that I'm like that's the right method I<br>think it's length of course it's drama<br>you have to spell everything out really<br>long<br>two okay so that's not right we actually<br>want that<br>and then we can do dot sum and that's<br>the solution<br>oh<br>oh because we have to sort and reverse<br>uh<br>Scala sort reverse yeah I should have<br>checked because that just didn't make<br>any sense okay<br>uh dot reverse<br>so that number looks bigger now it's<br>going to be like you have to wait be<br>patient<br>I have 35 seconds left to wait okay<br>let's let's find let's want to actually<br>check this uh can I do is there like a<br>two list<br>okay good<br>that seems reasonable<br>I'm not a league code bro I'm calling in<br>Scala boys it's difficult okay you know<br>but<br>there's six seconds left to wait all<br>right remind me not to get the wrong<br>answer anymore<br>I also ordered some meatballs so maybe<br>they'll be here that'd be nice where's<br>my fucking meatballs bro okay return to<br>my advent calendar<br>wait I have I solved this doesn't it<br>where's my stars<br>where are my gold stars<br>oh I'm not logged in for some reason<br>I don't know whatever<br>okay uh the owls begin to set up camp on<br>the beach<br>a giant rock paper scissors tournament<br>is already in progress<br>fetch two<br>then copy one go dot Scala<br>first round<br>I don't understand<br>okay<br>let's take a look at the data so I kind<br>of understand that<br>okay so it's just basically which ones I<br>I couldn't understand<br>um so let's first parse this as we can<br>use the other thing we can read the<br>lines let's read the lines<br>let's read the lines boys what are the<br>lines<br>let's copy this at a chat GPT<br>oh to list what if I don't do two lists<br>it's an array<br>import.txt okay we have lines<br>um<br>the score for a single round is the<br>score for the shape you selected okay<br>X for rock one for paper<br>so let's just make a function called<br>score that takes in a string<br>and returns an end so that's not how I<br>write that it's just this right<br>so we want to do x dot split<br>I really want to split that's pretty<br>expensive<br>can I just get like<br>well eventually I want to say lines.map<br>score<br>um<br>that's um but actually let's not do some<br>first<br>let's just print out on that<br>and let's also make small input<br>which is just that we can check on the<br>small input<br>uh Scala go dot Scala now we wait for<br>the jvm to load okay uh what'd I do<br>wrong<br>I was mad because it doesn't return it<br>in okay return zero<br>just Returns the oh great oh you gotta<br>set because<br>sequels<br>toxic chat today<br>bro don't be toxic bro<br>value get is not a member of string okay<br>how do I get the character app<br>okay that might be right<br>can you tell me what type this is<br>I should really just be doing this in a<br>rebel okay good<br>um<br>let's make a map<br>I don't know<br>there's nine combinations here should we<br>just write them all out you have to pay<br>for free speech here that's right<br>Freedom isn't free boys Freedom isn't<br>free<br>oh man you know how fast I'd be at this<br>in Python<br>oh so fast<br>shape you selected<br>so there is this component of it well<br>here<br>so we should be able to make a map<br>um<br>map<br>X okay<br>so there's two components to the score<br>there's this component which says you<br>get one two<br>and three<br>uh do I have to do dot get on the map<br>okay so this is one component of the<br>score<br>let's just return that component of the<br>score and see if it's right<br>um let's also print out an X<br>uh found options<br>why is that option<br>um<br>I don't want it to be an option I wanted<br>to assert I think I can just dot get in<br>order to do that<br>non.get no that's not right<br>oh because it's probably not the the<br>skull I have like a character type which<br>is like this<br>the thing is I don't know what type that<br>is<br>I mean I've seen that in other languages<br>maybe that's right okay cool okay great<br>so that's right<br>um now we need<br>the other one<br>we need to figure out who the winner is<br>okay<br>um<br>this is kind of ugly but I could just do<br>this<br>plus equals valid and Scala<br>okay uh a draw is if x zero equals<br>equals x two<br>um we need a Scala in line if if<br>then<br>I'll do this<br>we need parentheses no matter what<br>three else zero<br>expression expected but if found that is<br>a fucking expression fuck you scar<br>great<br>I don't have any draws there<br>uh we should have a draw CC should be a<br>draw I don't understand that should add<br>three<br>oh no it doesn't actually equal we have<br>to like map it back oh<br>all right<br>um<br>fix<br>fix dot dot dot get<br>an extra comma there<br>that's right now we also have to check<br>for winning<br>um so what's winning<br>draw<br>base win okay<br>um if<br>X Sub 0 equals<br>no there's I really should just map<br>these to integers and then check the<br>integers right<br>um<br>Rock<br>if my opponent played Rock<br>and is it and or is it like that and I<br>played paper<br>uh<br>actually you know what I should probably<br>do I should probably just invert this<br>and write<br>or<br>plus equals three sorry like I'm so bad<br>in this language that<br>score plus equals three okay so that's<br>if the opponent played Rock and I played<br>paper the opponent played paper and I<br>paid played scissors<br>and if I played<br>uh scissors and the opponent played<br>with the opponent plate scissors and I<br>played Rock<br>the total score would be 15.<br>the fact that Twitter is predominantly<br>written skull is an Evidence of why this<br>whole quiet quitting entitled culture in<br>Silicon Valley is a problem<br>oh it's really not<br>I think so I I think that the choice of<br>skull and Twitter was was less dumb than<br>you think I did like I found like the<br>guy who like really wrote all of it the<br>code the a lot of the Scala is very nice<br>there's not that much of a problem with<br>it and also remember it wasn't chosen<br>today<br>it's better than Java<br>what would you use instead of scholar<br>okay and then we can just do some here<br>and then let's run this<br>is my answer right let's find out<br>yay I got a gold star<br>anyway the second column y means you<br>need to the second column says how the<br>round needs to end<br>oh I see okay that's difficult all right<br>get ready for difficult work<br>ill oh leeches is written in Scala<br>interesting you would use Java or python<br>Java is really disgusting yeah I don't<br>think kotlin existed right like let's<br>figure out when kotlin came around<br>it looks very much wait this just looks<br>like Scala<br>hmm<br>yeah and it first showed up too late<br>okay well you can't use Python do you<br>understand how slow python is<br>like python is not a serious choice for<br>any sort of uh wait I gotta check where<br>my food is hang on<br>where's my food<br>oh<br>wait what<br>did it arrive is it downstairs I hate<br>when they put it downstairs<br>where's my food<br>because meatballs aren't at my door I'm<br>gonna be mad<br>foreign<br>oh guys I

34<br>anyway let's get our money back all<br>right 220 calories of chips sweet potato<br>chips<br>foreign<br>Twitter was originally in Ruby<br>foreign<br>let's just write the transformer for<br>this<br>um<br>all right you know what let's just write<br>this<br>map okay<br>ax means we need to lose<br>so this should be<br>we should have done this with numbers<br>that was a smart way to do this that's<br>why I would have done it in Python but<br>I heard a noise outside there's some<br>chance that's my meatballs<br>keep awesome<br>no meatballs<br>I don't want to like instacart or<br>something get some real food up in here<br>we also have some white cheddar popcorn<br>to eat next<br>yeah you get the food and your money<br>back that's winning<br>if I need to lose<br>given Rock I need to choose scissors<br>um<br>I'm going to lose here I'm going to<br>choose that<br>and that<br>and then if I need to draw<br>and if I need a win<br>this is just going to be um<br>b c a<br>hey<br>on the map we want to get x sub 2 we<br>want to call get again and then we want<br>to say Val C2 that<br>12.<br>no such element<br>no I don't know we just get for x<br>y c a y there<br>um what did that work<br>c-a-y<br>does the string have like crap after it<br>that I can't see<br>there's a y I don't understand<br>that<br>oh<br>this isn't right<br>this is actually z x y x y z<br>12. wow<br>great<br>let's return to my Advent calendar wait<br>did it just say I could share on Macedon<br>that's expensive<br>what's LSP<br>as a Twitter employee I'm offended by<br>your suggestion that I share on Mastodon<br>okay<br>rucksack reorganization<br>[Applause]<br>um we definitely want the other type<br>where we read the lines<br>okay<br>see really I should write scripts which<br>automatically like extract that<br>[Applause]<br>so we need to split them<br>find the combination<br>um<br>did I use substring in the other one<br>I feel like I use something else<br>slice<br>um<br>okay that's correct<br>uh now we need to find the one that's<br>the similar in both<br>or the index of Scala<br>we're getting nine minus one okay so S2<br>dot index of is this algorithm wrong<br>I think this algorithm is unsquared<br>whatever I have a fast computer skull is<br>very fast runs on the jvm<br>um not equal to minus one<br>[Applause]<br>um<br>is it char<br>now we need to do this other look up<br>uh okay one through<br>um<br>yeah they're eating my fucking meatballs<br>it was unbelievable<br>more people should be fired<br>you have one job it was bringing my<br>meatballs and you didn't do it<br>and now I'm eating sweet potato chips<br>and popsy all this disgusting oh now I<br>got chips everywhere which is terrible<br>it's terrible<br>this is terrible I'm I'm so upset I hate<br>San Francisco with my fucking meatballs<br>like ah<br>[Music]<br>do this<br>for free speech that's why we love free<br>speech<br>all right wait we can't remember<br>essentially clean the floor off<br>scholar charger and<br>[Music]<br>um<br>so if it is actually uh<br>our preparation applications come before<br>and ASCII so if V1<br>um<br>Less Than Zero<br>V2 else V1<br>233 not right<br>I hate that I can't put two arguments<br>into the print function like a normal<br>print function<br>they use like one of these<br>okay the L's are wrong<br>oh<br>oops<br>wait what<br>why are they showing up multiple times<br>oh they're shot multiple times ah<br>okay<br>they show up multiple times guys I'm<br>eating disgusting food shop<br>flops up<br>I'm triggered ma'am where's my meatballs<br>they took my spaghetti<br>I want you to fix it<br>157 right<br>they took my spaghetti<br>we can have a different badge item type<br>foreign<br>so basically<br>instead of splitting it in half we need<br>to<br>yes<br>and we need the other kind<br>I'm going to group them by three<br>how do I do that<br>she's an upsetting for Loop<br>the Phillips are too upsetting<br>I can't believe anyone ever used for<br>Loops they're so upsetting<br>how do I skip three<br>OH ZIP<br>zip either data three<br>trip cloth you know Scala<br>is this actually right or you just<br>don't know I'm in a mediocre apartment<br>in a terrible City<br>I don't understand anyone lives here but<br>how do I zip<br>uh no I'm okay okay I guess I could do<br>that if I can slice can I slice<br>I want like the colon colon three right<br>I see how to do it with zap<br>no of course it doesn't work beautifully<br>like python slice<br>every<br>let's not chat TBT<br>Scala every<br>third element in Array<br>you can use the grouped along with the<br>mapped and flat oh grouped oh<br>oh man that's some fire Scala<br>um<br>head<br>flatten<br>wait there's gonna be fire if this works<br>foreign<br>let's do it on small<br>I'm asking you<br>know we don't want to flatten I know<br>what we want to do<br>map<br>let's try that<br>close<br>um<br>I'm gonna flatten we want to concaten we<br>want to join<br>Scala joined string into list<br>or the other way around<br>see how to create a single string<br>oh dot make string<br>fire bro okay now we can do dot grouped<br>two<br>um this isn't exactly right because we<br>have to<br>Scala unzip<br>or I should be able to<br>map<br>that's gonna bitch and tell me some<br>iterator again<br>dot map<br>case x y<br>eval x y<br>mismatch error found x n e y but it's<br>grouped I don't understand<br>slice notation in scholar is that useful<br>to vector<br>or would I ever want a vector I hate<br>vectors<br>let me get the elements<br>actually kind of your Gap<br>value get is not a member of list string<br>I think it's not get it's just<br>scholarly's zero Index right it's not<br>like evil Lua iterator I love iterator<br>52.<br>oh that seems right<br>let's do some I'll get 70.<br>52.<br>wait what<br>the first group all the only type that<br>appears in all three okay never mind<br>we're doing this wrong<br>oh<br>okay<br>we have to find the one that's common in<br>all three<br>so we're close here<br>70. cool<br>or we're scholar Geniuses bros we're<br>scholar geniuses<br>this food was disgusting<br>should we followed up with a wheat and<br>gluten-free cookie<br>this is a real food normally don't eat<br>this<br>app there's no wheat and there's no<br>gluten what does it have in it<br>you know I'm hangry right now I eat a<br>fucking Snickers that's how hungry I am<br>I like Snickers<br>I don't like peanut butter<br>all right should we try Uber Eats again<br>I'm sorry Chad I haven't interacted with<br>you all the time but hopefully you like<br>that I've been writing Scala instructor<br>and that's what we all like to see on<br>streams right<br>do you like to see me be a noob and<br>struggle<br>[Music]<br>I know many people might work all of<br>them<br>you just gets things because he's famous<br>vaping<br>all right GrubHub<br>doordash really fucks up do I even have<br>a doordash account I'm sorry chat<br>thank you<br>it's pretty more water for my tea<br>the Twitter huge<br>ten times over<br>elon's not a big fan of feeding people<br>granola cookie bake all right fine it's<br>fine<br>we'll eat this<br>oh it just smells bad no I can't I can't<br>oh<br>vaping is my new hobby I Vape I play<br>chess and I go on Twitter<br>all right<br>they're probably the apartment never<br>mind uh<br>what's with the new skinhead haircut I<br>gotta look hardcore man<br>Vape is probably bad for you<br>how bad for you right a lot of things<br>are bad for you<br>smoking is bad for you<br>we have more water for my nice calming<br>tea<br>um<br>I know this is a terrible place this is<br>a terrible place<br>so at<br>you see me in San Diego I'm chill man<br>you know you know magic problem with my<br>favorite words<br>where should Twitter relocate to San<br>Diego man<br>Twitter wants me to stay at work that<br>longer San Diego<br>um San Jose is oh you like San Jose just<br>hold this holder<br>no Austin guys Austin is just San<br>Francisco running it back turbo like<br>it's it's not better<br>you can't have these ultra-left cities<br>like why<br>because people like them because they<br>have like like hipster coffee and stuff<br>like it's not worth it guys it's not<br>worth it<br>the shitty politics of your city will<br>creep into your tech company and you'll<br>end up with the Twitter files<br>all right<br>like these people are like like they<br>think you know these people here are<br>whacked out of their mind man they don't<br>say things like homeless you see what<br>what's like the politically correct word<br>for homeless now it's like unhoused<br>persons right like anyone who talks like<br>that is fucked<br>no I mean everyone knew the Twitter<br>files look like when Snowden came out I<br>mean I thought this is all nothing<br>Burger too like holy shit yeah of course<br>the NSA is spying on all your you know<br>Communications of course they're logging<br>all the metadata right like everyone<br>knew that everyone knew what all the<br>Twitter files were too like yeah Twitter<br>banned you from search like there's a<br>tool online to check this everyone knows<br>this<br>yeah well work from home's another hole<br>why do I want to work from this<br>oh man I'm just agitated you know<br>agitated it's like oh go outside and<br>enjoy something nice no I won't<br>um Twitter files are basic corporate<br>Behavior I mean we had a sort of<br>it's not<br>yes<br>the corporate behavior is broken is<br>basically what I'm gonna say<br>I agree and like look those people are<br>not terrible people you all understand<br>their decisions in isolation<br>but then when you like zoom out and say<br>wait a second<br>what are we building here right that's a<br>lot of the problem Twitter didn't<br>understand what they were building right<br>Elon says all the time this is the<br>Public Square I old Twitter never said<br>that<br>or they might have but you know they<br>just lost their way like what were they<br>actually building they were not trying<br>to build a Public Square<br>they were trying to build uh something<br>actually much more resembling a modern<br>Newsroom<br>oh<br>Google search sucks now not because<br>Google's been captured by ideologues<br>Google search sucks now because there's<br>no more internet to search<br>um what did I get done this week oh I<br>found some very interesting stuff this<br>week<br>like just I'm looking into there and<br>look Elon wants me to fix search<br>and<br>I don't know I mean this isn't secret<br>I'll talk about it like I can do<br>basically one or two things<br>I can ship a bunch of small mediocre<br>features or I can build you a really<br>impressive demo that won't be able to be<br>shipped for two years right like what do<br>you want<br>sorry the best engineer in the world<br>can't like ship this demo<br>um I'm not going to go into the reasons<br>why but like yes you can build<br>incredible demos that use modern large<br>language models use modern image<br>embeddings use like<br>fancy contrast of methods to figure out<br>what you want deploy rlhf in real time<br>yeah like you can do all these things<br>but not in 12 weeks<br>right and a lot of these things require<br>you to build up good infrastructure<br>beforehand I say this all the time at<br>comma the goal is not like solving<br>self-driving cars will be easy Once you<br>build the right infrastructure to do it<br>um<br>no no no no no I can't I can't stay in<br>this city more than 12 weeks man I miss<br>Alex I miss San Diego<br>uh<br>there's nothing about Twitter Twitter's<br>actually pretty nice<br>um though<br>we do need good food good food's<br>important to me common is good food<br>um how many more weeks uh I'm three<br>weeks in to 12 weekend to your chat<br>um<br>yeah the city's just<br>agitation and I I like I remember how I<br>used to feel when I lived here<br>how's the talent generally pretty good<br>actually<br>um you know I think that<br>the people who stayed are exactly sort<br>of the right people<br>uh there's some very good Engineers<br>there<br>right and yeah like<br>you know I am maybe there's a few more<br>to to uh<br>you know not not everyone but<br>most of the people I meet are very good<br>tiling window manager no I'm Italian<br>right there<br>when I stay at Twitter if they move to<br>another city if they move to San Diego I<br>think about it yeah<br>if they move to San Diego I'd think<br>about it and like look I could build<br>some really incredible ml stuff for<br>Twitter but it's going to take a year<br>um and I think there is much more<br>pressing priorities there right so again<br>nothing secret Twitter used to have<br>uh 7 500 people right<br>your code base reflects your<br>organization so when you have an<br>organization that is very clearly<br>overstaffed you have a code base that's<br>very very bloated<br>uh now<br>you know<br>what I would do is spend a lot of time<br>refactoring but you have to make a<br>choice do you want refactoring or do you<br>want features right and you can scream<br>both as loud as you want but you're not<br>going to get both<br>you're going to get<br>probably actually features if you scream<br>that you want both refactors and<br>features you're going to get features<br>uh<br>the slack channels are probably fun<br>though<br>yeah<br>you know they're they're not Bombshells<br>to discover it's all basically what you<br>think<br>um like I said I I promise you the<br>talent bar or Twitter has gone from here<br>to here now the the people currently at<br>Twitter are probably the average Twitter<br>employee now is probably considerably<br>more talented than the average Twitter<br>employee was right the good people they<br>believe<br>um there was a tweet I liked it was like<br>so the greatest entrepreneur uh you know<br>of Our Generation comes and buys your<br>company imagine what you could learn<br>from him imagine the impact you could<br>make imagine the opportunity but no you<br>resign LOL right like<br>um but if I refactor I can guarantee<br>three times performance<br>well can you right you can get there you<br>can get there and refactorings are<br>required refactoring can improve both<br>your performance and your velocity of<br>features but it takes time and there are<br>not obvious results tomorrow<br>so that's sort of the problem<br>um<br>I mean Elon is clearly you know whatever<br>I think maybe elon's doing the wrong<br>thing I do remember that he's a<br>billionaire and I'm not<br>uh so on average his decisions are<br>better than mine right and this is true<br>you can look at it you know it's the<br>same thing in chess right like someone<br>on average who has a higher rating than<br>you is making better moves than you<br>can I share the architecture of Twitter<br>I mean it's mostly public right well for<br>natural and finagle stuff is used<br>um you can you could read all that uh<br>that's like that Mike services<br>how's Advent code I'm not really doing<br>it this year<br>um I don't have time you look at my<br>GitHub my GitHub it's sad my github's<br>not even there's no green on my GitHub<br>right now<br>it's all it's all empty<br>um is Twitter bloated with microservices<br>uh look what Elon said was accurate<br>got to day nine and you're like meh<br>I don't I think microservices are a good<br>idea<br>um for the most part I I think that uh<br>it maybe has been taken to an episode<br>extreme<br>Alice I don't think Scala is a bad<br>choice I think skull is a fine<br>programming language like good luck I<br>mean look look at the code I've been<br>writing right<br>let me clean up all these stupid print<br>statements<br>that's pretty nice actually<br>I don't think I could write it much<br>faster in Python there's there's nothing<br>in Python there's nothing like called<br>grouped in Python is there not that I<br>know of<br>yeah there's no group to buy them<br>um in Python I would do like Zip and<br>then zero colon colon three and then one<br>colon colon three two column three<br>uh why not go Lang I mean yeah golang is<br>probably a better choice for<br>microservices than Scala that's what I<br>would choose today<br>but<br>I I mean I think there are more go<br>Engineers again there's nothing<br>fundamentally wrong with Scala<br>this is your favorite Scala project oh<br>chisel I don't know chisel was written<br>in sky<br>sorry this is gonna be a short stream<br>today I'm uh<br>maybe maybe I'll do one more at that<br>code<br>we have 843 people here all right we'll<br>do some more coding<br>I'm just I'm hungry<br>I'm hungry and I gotta get food all<br>right let's try ordering again<br>should we try Uber Eats part two<br>Getty<br>Istanbul Grill King of Thai Noodle<br>Grandma's homemade pasta I got some from<br>Grandma's homemade pasta it was very<br>mediocre so I tried a different pasta<br>place<br>should we just order the same thing<br>again<br>no it was 30 something dollars<br>so we should probably go out it's<br>raining<br>foreign<br>we'll do one more we'll do we'll do one<br>more problem and then I'm gonna go out<br>and find food<br>order the same thing but say it's for a<br>cop bro I don't think they like cops<br>around here<br>uh<br>look I'll Advocate as much as I can to<br>open source Twitter's infrastructure<br>you know but again when you look at<br>elon's other companies he hasn't really<br>open sourced much it was a struggle to<br>get Tesla to open source the Linux their<br>Linux kernel even which you legally have<br>to<br>um tiny cores and Scholar chisel<br>there's nothing really wrong with uh<br>with Scala<br>yeah I miss tiny grad I missed the tiny<br>Corp<br>all right<br>um<br>day four<br>consider the following section<br>assignment pairs<br>um<br>let me say uh fully contains the other<br>how many assignment pairs does one range<br>fully contain the other okay this is not<br>too hard so we're going to do lines dot<br>split<br>but see it can't be split<br>okay uh<br>[Music]<br>this is the last one guys<br>Can I some Bulls<br>clogbull is probably fine okay so we<br>want x dot<br>[Music]<br>um<br>can I split on two things<br>you can also split based on a regular<br>expression<br>and really what I want to do is like<br>that that might work<br>so in Scala VAR changes Val doesn't<br>true I'm just gonna bitch and be like uh<br>oh yeah I gotta equals here<br>no implicit ordering to find for be fine<br>L Javelin string<br>okay good<br>that works great I know my right Axis<br>okay<br>um we want to figure out if does one<br>range fully contain the uh there so<br>let's map<br>two inch<br>all right and then we can say a sub zero<br>all right so if it fully contains<br>then we have a sub 0 less than or equal<br>to a sub 2<br>and a sub 3 is less than or equal to a<br>sub 1.<br>or<br>the other way around<br>ah this one contains this one<br>um I'm gonna close that and one l0<br>453.<br>all right uh uh it's quite a bit of<br>duplicate work the number of pairs that<br>overlap at all how many overlap at all<br>okay<br>so if we want to know overlaps at all we<br>just have to check if<br>any of the numbers are in common<br>so I think I just need to check<br>uh<br>uh see this is like where like there's<br>like some people can do this very very<br>fast and that's his winning Advent code<br>if you train yourself a bit you get like<br>very fast at these things<br>we're not really trying to speed run<br>here we're just kind of<br>we're just kind of chilling and thinking<br>about how to write beautiful Scala<br>um okay so if this one is in the middle<br>we can just check this<br>or<br>this<br>can't hurt to check the others too<br>and there's<br>919<br>great<br>and Scholar three<br>yeah<br>uh<br>this one look fun that looks awful<br>we didn't have to even write any<br>algorithms this is all just like string<br>parsing<br>which is kind of lame<br>um no I mean I don't know like having a<br>code just like the times one of my<br>complaints about evident code last year<br>was that like the solve times for these<br>things was like a minute and we'll solve<br>times a minute you're no longer<br>rewarding like people who can program<br>you're rewarding people who have good<br>infrastructure and just happen to be<br>like like it's it's a reading<br>comprehension test instead of a<br>programming test<br>um which I mean it's still fun but it's<br>just not like<br>look at day 10 you found it pretty<br>enjoyable okay should we skip to 10. no<br>I can't do anything I need food<br>I need food let's look at ten Ten's<br>enjoyable<br>oh I do like things like this you know I<br>really like the first year I did it they<br>had a uh like an interpreter<br>they wrote like a tiny interpreter and<br>they built on it and every other one I<br>thought it was really cool<br>okay<br>[Music]<br>all right we'll do this one too<br>add V takes two cycles to complete<br>there's nothing like the op code thing<br>day 10 was math<br>[Music]<br>um<br>like the login pop-ups back<br>uh<br>that upsets me if that's true<br>nine is more fun than ten<br>I don't know no I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm done<br>with this<br>I gotta eat<br>uh look if the login pop-ups back like<br>that's that's that's so upsetting to<br>hear<br>um they don't have pieces that deliver<br>the login pop-up was gone for I removed<br>it for 99 of people the other one<br>percent look there's like PM still who<br>like<br>oh you can close it now okay as long as<br>you can close it<br>I'm not fighting it's it's a stupid<br>political battle like<br>you're just you're just you're just<br>losing I tried I tried guys<br>click on oh you have to click on login<br>and then click X oh my God<br>Knitter project in shambles now should<br>we build a Twitter competitor<br>foreign<br>should we build a clean Twitter<br>how do we build it<br>how would we build new clean Twitter<br>oh it never allowed you to browse likes<br>or media<br>what's actually wrong with Mastodon I've<br>heard that all people do it you know the<br>problem with Mastodon is the same<br>problem with troop social and parlor<br>right<br>so when like these new ones show up<br>who goes who legitimately signed up for<br>truth social and was like this is going<br>to be a community I want to be a part of<br>nobody right you got a bunch of like<br>rabid Trump fans and you know it sucked<br>it was a terrible Community right<br>um mastodon's the same thing right<br>the but it you know usually people are<br>used to this happening with like the<br>right-win people fragmenting like when<br>Reddit kicks off the Donald and they go<br>to the donald.win right like it's it's<br>usually people it's the right wing who<br>leaves but on Mastodon it was the left<br>wing who laughed all the oh you know<br>Twitter is owned by a billionaire and I<br>hate billionaires I'm gonna go to<br>Mastodon where they know how to run a<br>social network<br>um<br>so yeah I mean the problem isn't even<br>the Mastodon technology it's like do I<br>really want to hang around those people<br>like everyone on Twitter I see who has<br>the Mastodon in their profile is like<br>this person doesn't seem cool man<br>uh what do I think of urban well I mean<br>or if it's a lot better right or Urban's<br>a lot better Urban suffers a lot less<br>from these uh<br>from these from these problems<br>uh all the cool people are showing<br>Twitter yeah I mean it's true right<br>all right I'm sorry there's no more<br>programming today I'm hungry my food<br>didn't show up<br>and try to order food with the GrubHub<br>app<br>uh no Urban does exist right so Urban's<br>interesting in the I mean urban has a I<br>think there's another like Arena like it<br>has this sort of<br>um<br>hipster early adopter vibe to it and the<br>the people there don't really seem like<br>it seems like there's like a political<br>balance there and it seems like people<br>are there because they're excited about<br>like<br>weird esoteric technology which is cool<br>like you can you can build a community<br>around that they're they're into like<br>artificial difficulty<br>right yeah who is a disaster right like<br>like knock and Hoon are not serious<br>programming languages right nobody would<br>argue that that hoon is like a serious<br>programming language<br>but it's it's kind of like the way<br>people like like<br>esoteric stuff<br>right<br>similar to like I mean I see some<br>overlap with like like the 8-Bit video<br>game Community right like the people are<br>like oh yeah look what I made the NES do<br>right<br>um am I on Twitter HQ no that's my<br>apartment<br>smoking a cigarette<br>um<br>there's a whole Twitter thing is<br>political one side believes the guy who<br>took over is against their politics well<br>yeah but you see look the problem is<br>like elon's not a political extremist at<br>all right Elon and he talks about this<br>all the time he's a Centrist<br>right so yes if their ideology is we are<br>far left Communists who believe that<br>like you know uh gendered pronouns<br>should be abolished and everyone should<br>just be they and you know we can all<br>look like NPCs yeah like if you believe<br>that yeah this guy's probably against<br>your politics but that's a wacko idea<br>right<br>um so yeah I mean yes anyone talks about<br>this too he's like well yeah we want the<br>extremists to leave right both the<br>extremists laughed and the extremist<br>right and yeah everyone like there<br>should no one wants extremists they're<br>just terrible<br>I mean yeah Elon reinstated Trump right<br>like<br>why was Trump banned in the first place<br>how absurd was that<br>it's just like<br>can you believe they actually banned the<br>president of the United States from<br>Twitter<br>and you can read like the justification<br>and it's absurd<br>it's not like uh it's not like uh you<br>know this guy was actually like<br>you know I mean<br>what did he do right<br>uh so if if if one side has a group<br>where you know that Donald Trump<br>shouldn't even be allowed to talk well<br>that's a bit extreme right I think it<br>would also be a bit extreme if someone<br>like you know wanted to kick Biden off<br>of Twitter right if Trump had reinstated<br>Trump and kicked Biden off yeah fuck<br>that guy right like no one wants that<br>right like this is this is the problem<br>um<br>right but you know you want to let<br>everybody talk and then let everybody<br>you know you should be able to listen to<br>everybody and make up your own mind if<br>you really like what Donald Trump has to<br>say you can listen to him right uh you<br>know<br>foreign<br>can we kick the terrorists off<br>I mean<br>who's a terrorist right<br>like one man's terrorist is another<br>man's Freedom Fighter right<br>it depends it depends what they're doing<br>are they you know where I think the line<br>should be I think the line should be<br>illegal in the United States right if if<br>they're posting things on Twitter that<br>are illegal in the United States like<br>imminent you know violent threats uh<br>child porn like things that are illegal<br>in the United States yeah you should be<br>kicked off Twitter otherwise you can<br>talk and people can listen or not<br>right<br>I mean they literally execute people<br>yeah but I mean I ran as a sovereign<br>country right<br>so you can say that you don't like them<br>and that's fine but are they breaking<br>United States law<br>and then also it's not like he's<br>executing people on Twitter<br>um<br>who's getting ad money from the EU yeah<br>I mean if the EU wants to pass laws<br>against legal speech in America then you<br>know what my take is fuck the EU man<br>like they can set up a great firewall if<br>they want<br>um yeah us doesn't execute anyone<br>exactly right like like the US is<br>responsible for more<br>killings and death and like<br>well great the Iran guy exit how many<br>people do we kill in Iraq like you know<br>um so it's different I mean what is a<br>country a country is a monopoly on<br>violence right the state is a monopoly<br>on violence so when a state does<br>violence it's not like an individual<br>doing violence<br>do I know what Elon and Tim Cook talked<br>about I really don't know I don't have<br>any insight that's not really just<br>what's on elon's Twitter<br>um like I don't know if Iran is bad<br>honestly I don't know enough about it<br>but I think that there should just be<br>like Fair very permissive rules on a<br>place you want to call the Town Square<br>and then like Scott Alexander has a has<br>a post where he talks about moderation<br>it's not censorship right if you don't<br>want to see Donald Trump's tweets that<br>should be your not right but like we're<br>trying to make a good platform right<br>yeah block Donald Trump Right add a<br>keyword block for Donald Trump great you<br>don't have to see it but to say that<br>like Donald Trump can't talk to somebody<br>who wants to hear him talk is absurd<br>right<br>like like censorship is when a third<br>when you have two parties who consent to<br>communicate and a third party says well<br>actually we're not going to allow them<br>to communicate right<br>I'm not turning Twitter into 4chan and<br>again there should be some<br>civility<br>right<br>um I mean Twitter for one is not really<br>anonymous<br>uh isn't there somebody you forgot to<br>ask that's right<br>um hate speech is not illegal in the U.S<br>there is no clear definition of hate<br>speech the U.S has this thing called a<br>Brandenburg test right<br>this is this is<br>this is basically the uh the limitations<br>on on on free speech<br>uh in America right<br>um cannot punish inflammatory speech<br>unless that speech is directed to<br>inciting or producing imminent Lawless<br>action and is likely to incite or<br>produce such action right imminent<br>Lawless action<br>and is likely to incite or produce such<br>action right you can do hate speech all<br>you want you can talk about how Hitler<br>was great you know you can talk about<br>how you know you you you you want all<br>the redheads to die like you can do that<br>but you know there's a test<br>hate speech doesn't protect you from<br>being punched in the face no it's<br>illegal to punch people in the face<br>right because someone<br>because someone says something you don't<br>like it's not okay to punch them in the<br>face right<br>oh so yeah yeah this is why Clips aren't<br>allowed right this is why Clips aren't<br>allowed actually I for full of contacts<br>I actually don't think Hitler was great<br>I think he was a loser uh I think he<br>killed himself sad in a bunker like he<br>was a loser man you know say what you<br>want even about what he believed like<br>the guy was a fucking loser<br>um<br>the core problem in America is that no<br>one understands Civics well they should<br>have paid attention in seventh grade<br>you had a wife one day and then I think<br>they dated but like not look I don't<br>know man I don't know my I don't know my<br>my hitlerology that much I said the guy<br>was like they didn't let him into art<br>school man the guy was a loser<br>[Music]<br>um<br>whenever EU demands matter so the rules<br>will be the average of the U.S and EU<br>yeah<br>yeah I don't agree<br>I don't know what if the EU would like<br>to stand up a great firewall and block<br>my website they can<br>uh<br>is there a line where you would say that<br>someone Justified being punched no<br>This Is How Free Speech works<br>do you know what I mean like it's not<br>okay to respond to speech with violence<br>like<br>basic American shit guys<br>um I'm not that interested in what Kanye<br>has to say he's got a he's awesome he's<br>on some weird Trip Man<br>no no it's not okay to punch people<br>because you don't like what they're<br>saying<br>oh<br>I I get yeah it's a mercy band man it<br>was a mercy band really<br>um you can verbally punch somebody<br>that's right you can you can you can you<br>know put a fire diss track together<br>that's all fine<br>um it's okay if you're a state yes it is<br>okay a state is a monopoly on violence<br>yes<br>all right uh politics is stupid guys uh<br>thank you for watching today's stream<br>uh<br>uh I I honestly I don't have an opinion<br>on Iran<br>um<br>is Twitter hiring yeah Twitter's hiring<br>Twitter's hiring uh<br>I'm not I'm interned I don't have any I<br>don't have any insight into that but I<br>do think uh<br>oh python three python 312's out<br>hungry I'm tired I hate this city<br>ah<br>you know you know the sad thing about<br>politics I heard a quote that upset me<br>it's like<br>you might not be interested in politics<br>but politics is interested in you so<br>like here's what I Hope's happening I<br>hope that like<br>a whole group of people who's just<br>absolutely fed up with the bullshit<br>shows up and you know look I think<br>elon's in this group right<br>politics is a little more appropriate<br>than usual because honestly why did I go<br>to Twitter<br>I came to work at Twitter because I<br>believe in free speech<br>I believe a lot in free speech I think<br>it's uh<br>you ever see the graph where it shows uh<br>IQ versus belief in free speech right<br>also you know<br>um<br>better salary and comma dying<br>November was our all-time profit record<br>at comma for a month<br>now we made more money in November than<br>we'd ever made before<br>uh thank you to everyone who

              "John playing checkers yeah I mean and again it's  <br>scanning the source of the internet to say like \n",

              "was some discussion about you know how did you  <br>again train the AI to learn about different styles \n",

just starting<br>out write your comments down below so<br>game design definitely is a specialized<br>feel and there's lots of skills that are<br>involved in that especially idea<br>generation basic game mechanics sound<br>design art illustration as well as 3D<br>modeling and even the feel of the game<br>game designers require a lot of deep<br>understanding of not only technical<br>skills but also creativity within the<br>game design environment I think chat GPT<br>and other AI tools as well are just that<br>they're just tools they're not going to<br>replace human designers anytime soon so<br>don't throw in the towel just yet I<br>think as human game designers we need to<br>grow yes I think we need to grow by<br>using these tools they're not only going<br>to make our jobs easier and they're<br>going to push our creativity and allow<br>us to accomplish way more just think how<br>much that's going to benefit the player<br>as a game designer I think Chad gbt and<br>all these other

leave a like and subscribe if you liked it</td></tr><tr><td>jzAdYVouN4M</td><td>[Music]<br>as a Founder I find it incredibly<br>difficult to find time to create content<br>I have so many other high-level tasks<br>and important things on my plate that<br>when it comes to content creation my<br>mental bandwidth has already been used<br>up I found it really difficult to be<br>creative so I discovered chat GPT and I<br>wanted to see if the tool could be used<br>to help me in my content creation<br>process so in this video I'll show you<br>three ways that I've discovered that you<br>can use chat GPT in your content<br>creation process again as a Founder I<br>know the importance of spending your<br>time on High level tasks and not the<br>tasks that don't generate revenue or<br>don't move your business forward<br>focusing on those high level tasks has<br>allowed me to build this second business<br>of my own to a million dollars a year in<br>Revenue within a year now I know that I<br>can focus on these high level tasks but<br>then content creation suffers I need to<br>focus on those high level tasks but<br>again content still needs to be created<br>so in this video I will be covering how<br>you can eliminate 99 percent of your<br>content creation process using chat GPT<br>so let's get started alright so once<br>you've logged into chat GPT it's really<br>easy to log in you just use your Gmail<br>login or just easily sign up you will<br>have to put in a phone number to verify<br>that you are who you are so once we're<br>in chat GPT Let's do an example of write<br>a blog article for avoiding burnout in a<br>startup and we'll see what it comes up<br>with<br>so now it'll start typing and we'll wait<br>until it's done<br>okay so chat GPT finished up it actually<br>already renamed my chat right there<br>avoiding burnout in startups and we have<br>a solid blog article and so the beauty<br>of chat GPT is that now I'm not working<br>with a blank page I gave a very basic<br>prompt avoiding burnout in a startup and<br>now I can go in with my personal<br>experiences my personal knowledge wisdom<br>and knowing who my audience is I can now<br>you know copy and paste this into a<br>Google doc and start editing it so maybe<br>I want to take out prioritize tasks or<br>maybe I want to combine these two points<br>or maybe I want to get rid of this point<br>or add a new point you know there's so<br>many it's endlessly customizable because<br>now I'm not starting with a blank page I<br>have this template basically here's a<br>template article about avoiding burnout<br>in a startup and so the the beauty of<br>chat gbt is giving you content that is<br>you know hopefully 99 of the way there<br>so there are other things that we can do<br>to find what chat GPT puts out and then<br>even a kind of supplementary material as<br>well so let's say write a title for that<br>blog article and let's see what it gives<br>us<br>five tips for avoiding burnout in a<br>startup great that's awesome we have a<br>summary for that blog article and so now<br>hopefully it'll just give us a brief<br>description of what the blog article is<br>about so now we can post that into a<br>social media post with a link to the<br>full actual blog article and so it gives<br>us this blog article provides tips for<br>avoiding burnout in a startup including<br>these Five Points by following these<br>tips startup employees can manage their<br>workload more effectively and maintain<br>their physical mental health beautiful<br>so now I have a title now I have a<br>description and now I have the full blog<br>article again which I can edit each one<br>of these but it's giving me some great<br>ideas to start with and you can even<br>have it you know ideate for you give you<br>ideas so we could say write pen titles<br>or that blog article and so now we can<br>choose between these 10 titles or use<br>you know part of this title and a part<br>of this title and we'll see what it<br>comes up with in just a second great so<br>now we have 10 ideas or different titles<br>for that blog Article Five simple<br>strategies for managing burnout in a<br>startup I think that's probably the best<br>one but you can use any of these right<br>that's the beauty of chat GPT so you can<br>also refine the blog article you can<br>always add additional criteria you could<br>even do you know write a 300 word blog<br>article about avoiding burnout and it<br>will do that for you so I've noticed it<br>doesn't keep exactly the 300 words it'll<br>be like 320 words but it's pretty close<br>and you know you can continue to refine<br>the queries and it will just continue to<br>put out a more and more polished output<br>which of course you know then you can<br>finish that one percent of effort really<br>personalize it for your audience and to<br>put it in your voice to get and to put<br>in your own personal experiences the<br>second way that we can use chat GPT in<br>our content creation strategy is for<br>newsletters so write a newsletter<br>about delegation and automation<br>all right so now chat gbt has given us a<br>rough template of a newsletter about<br>delegation and automation you can see<br>it's in the rough structure of a<br>newsletter again I wouldn't send this<br>right away but I would put in my own<br>personal experiences I would structure<br>it maybe a little bit differently put in<br>you know three points which you could<br>probably also tell chat gbt to do for<br>you just you know come up with three of<br>your top tips when it comes to<br>delegation and automation so let's see<br>what other you know queries can we give<br>chat GPT about writing a newsletter we<br>could say instead of write a newsletter<br>about delegation and automation we could<br>say instead maybe something a little bit<br>more complicated so write a newsletter<br>about what happens when a company hits a<br>growth wall and we'll see if it comes up<br>with anything good for that all right<br>great so chat GPT has given us a solid<br>newsletter about what happens when a<br>company hits a growth wall assess the<br>cause of the gross slowdown when you hit<br>a growth wall your company's growth<br>begins to slow or just Plateau<br>completely and so that could mean that<br>you need to invest in marketing and<br>sales you need to increase the amount of<br>new customers coming in or you can<br>decrease churn so you know assess the<br>cause of the gross slow down extremely<br>important so I would structure this<br>differently and I would introduce<br>Concepts a little bit differently but<br>it's a again it's a great starting point<br>for a newsletter about what happens when<br>a company hits a growth wall now the<br>third point or the third way that chat<br>GPT can help us when it comes to<br>creating content is for our social media<br>so if I want to post daily on LinkedIn<br>which I have been doing for about a year<br>it does get exhausting after a while of<br>constantly coming up with new topics new<br>ideas and new posts so again let's ask<br>chat GPT how it can help us with that<br>ideas for a LinkedIn post directed<br>towards startup Founders and let's see<br>what it comes up with all right great so<br>now we have five ideas of different<br>posts I could make on LinkedIn about<br>directed towards startup Founders Five<br>Lessons I've learned as a startup<br>founder the importance of mentorship for<br>Founders the role of failure in the<br>startup Journey the benefits of<br>diversity and inclusion in startup teams<br>and the power of networking for startup<br>Founders and I could even say generate<br>let's say I'm not happy with those first<br>ideas or I've already used them generate<br>five more ideas<br>all right great so now it's coming up<br>with five more ideas which are all solid<br>ideas that I would use for a LinkedIn<br>post now let's get started on our next<br>query which would be let's say write a<br>script or a tick tock video directed<br>towards startup Founders shot list<br>include in table format let's see what<br>that comes up with all right so I am<br>continually impressed by what chat GPT<br>can come up with we've got at the very<br>beginning a shot list it's not in table<br>format but that's fine so it's got these<br>eight different shots that we should<br>include in The Tick Tock video and now<br>it goes down into the script and these<br>are all the things that I should be<br>saying and then look you know right here<br>it includes okay now move to shot two<br>which we can see you know what that is a<br>shot of a person sitting at a desk<br>typing on a laptop and looking focused<br>and then it says you know go to shot<br>three shot four shot five so it's really<br>cool to see how it structured this<br>script and I'm sure there's a lot of<br>people that would say okay you know<br>those shots suck or you know that script<br>isn't great but it gives me a starting<br>point now I know okay yeah I don't want<br>that in that shot but now I have a<br>better idea of what I do want in that<br>shot or you know the rough structure for<br>this Tick Tock video and so all of these<br>different things as I've been saying<br>throughout the video it's just so<br>helpful to start with not a blank page<br>and start with some rough structure of<br>how it could look and then you can know<br>really quickly what you do want it to<br>look like and what does work in what<br>chat GPT has given you and what doesn't<br>work so it's very easy for you to add<br>and take away what jet GPT has given you<br>and condense it down into something that<br>will actually be successful and that<br>will actually be presentable for your<br>audience<br>now this isn't perfect but it's much<br>better than any other AI tool that I've<br>used in generating content paid or free<br>and it's easy to refine the content that<br>chat GPT puts out and it's really easy<br>to just add in your own personal<br>experiences your own personal wisdom and<br>of course make sure that everything<br>sounds like it's coming from you that it<br>has your voice so if you're a business<br>owner in need of content go use chat gbt<br>especially while it's still free and<br>pump out as much content as you can you<br>can always refine it later follow me<br>here on YouTube if you want to learn<br>more about startup systems and how to<br>systematize your business I want to help<br>Founders win back their time through<br>Automation and delegation</td></tr><tr><td>Bll_Ws_NNtk</td><td>It's Christmas time again and everyone is in a festive mood.<br>But there is something lurking in the shadows, something that could ruin all the fun.<br>I'm talking about ChatGPT, the tool of artificial intelligence that conquers the internet in a storm.<br>From a superficial point of view, ChatGPT seems to be a harmless possibility to<br>pass the time a little. You type in a message and it answers with a<br>click. But in reality ChatGPT is dangerous. It has the ability to learn and adapt.<br>And it is not always clear what it thinks. At Christmas, when people are in a good mood and<br>share their joy with others, ChatGPT can take advantage of this. It can entice people<br>to give personal information or even persuade them to do something<br>that they might regret. So be especially careful in this Christmas season and think<br>twice before you get involved with ChatGPT. You never know what's ahead.<br>Sorry, I couldn't resist that. This intro was of course created with an AI,<br>more precisely with ChatGPT. ChatGPT is a software created by OpenAI,<br>which is based on the GPT-3 AI. Incidentally, this is the same one that also works in the background for<br>DOLI or Replica, which I have already dealt with in more detail.<br>ChatGPT is a pure chat application, but it can assist rather than really<br>communicate out of this chat. The applications are diverse. I don't know if you've seen it on<br>social media, but there's everything from chats with fictitious people to<br>song texts. And of course you can ask critically how far an AI can go,<br>which data it can use, will I lose my job and so much more.<br>We won't do that here. But I will be asking these questions on my other channel<br>next year, the Morphois, the former vlog channel. So if you are interested in a more general approach<br>to this topic, feel free to stop by. This is about how ChatGPT can and will<br>change the lives of developers and IT people for us and how much fear of loss of jobs we really<br>have to have. Before we start, next Friday at 2 p.m. there will be a little Christmas party<br>on my Twitch, where we will do a community quiz. So I will create the quiz and you can<br>participate and dust off the winners. Everyone over 18 can participate and I would be very happy<br>if you all came by. Streaming is a bit more personal than such a video.<br>Nevertheless, here are your life-changing tips. First, generate code. Let's start with the<br>most obvious. ChatGPT builds code for you. You heard right, you can just ask for it.<br>I have had Python code for the MergeSort Sort Here algorithm built for this video<br>here for testing purposes. And look, it really worked. See for yourself, the code is functional,<br>the variables are well named, the code itself is also quite Pythonic, for example, uses<br>R, i.e. a list from beginning to end or from middle to end, and it has damn good<br>documentation. It is all created as a function and it contains example code to test it right away.<br>What the actual? Of course I played around a little more and have to say, the code that is generated<br>is not bad, but of course not error-free either. In many cases where no<br>frequent algorithm was asked, there were already a few errors. But such a coding challenge<br>was not only solved. No, the naive algorithm would run in O of n3. The<br>chatGPT algorithm runs more efficiently than that and is even documented cleanly. But is that really<br>the case? Take a closer look. Second, tests. To be able to really say that, the human<br>programmer has to write unit tests, right? No, wrong. You can also simply use chatGPT to generate tests<br>and do that completely without foreknowledge and with a really impressive test coverage.<br>I mean, look at that. The good thing about it is that the function must or should of course not know chatGPT<br>in advance. Because chatGPT writes the tests, you the implementation or you let<br>chatGPT do that again. Third, several languages. You are not Python developers? Well, no problem.<br>chatGPT can also obviously also JavaScript and PHP and C and what the... can even bank Cobol.<br>Investment now. So I think the Cobol can, I can't. That's problematic,<br>but hey, why is Cobol code actually so incredibly long?<br>By the way, it's even possible to brainfuck. So I think. Fourth, Stack Overflow. We all know<br>the worst situation in the everyday life of a developer. You are looking for a bug online<br>and can't find a Stack Overflow post that fits. Now you have two options. Try it yourself<br>or write a post and both are more scary than the Christmas brunch with the family.<br>If you post yourself, you will probably be made too dirty. If you try it yourself, it is suddenly<br>weekend again. Fear Not chatGPT is no. A simple explanation for, for example, main in<br>Python spits out the AI without any problems, including a nice explanation. A bit more complex<br>tasks you have to read through two or three times. The answer itself is<br>actually quite good, especially if you ask things that are perhaps very specific.<br>But what we see here again, individual questions work quite well, but there can also be<br>errors contained, which can be problematic with such problems. But to be honest,<br>that it even knows this very niche bug is impressive. There are even problem<br>solutions included. And what we should not forget, not all Stack Overflow answers are correct.<br>Fifth, optimize code. You can also give chatGPT algorithms that should optimize it for you.<br>In this example here I generated a random number between 1 and 100 and regenerated it<br>until it was divisible by 4. O of pretty long. Potentially, the thing runs infinitely.<br>chatGPT spits out code from house that is much more efficient. First generate a random number<br>between 1 and 25 and then multiply by 4. That was even the solution I had<br>thought of before and it runs the O of 1. Insanely impressive if you ask me.<br>If you now benchmark your code and optimize this one function, which takes up a large part of the<br>overall runtime, this could really lead to much faster software without a lot of work.<br>Sixth, look for security gaps. You are not sure if you may have a<br>security gap in your code? You can also ask chatGPT here. In this example<br>I don't even ask directly for security problems, I just ask if the thing is okay.<br>I even get directly told that the function I use is outdated, i.e. deprecated,<br>and that a SQL injection is possible. In the end, a few suggestions come and even<br>additionally functional good code. Hopefully that was really okay.<br>Seventh, let yourself be explained code. Are you not sure what this one<br>strange colleague did there? You can even be analyzed what a special code actually does.<br>Sometimes it's not that easy, but still impressive.<br>I tried to find something he doesn't recognize, but he even recognized a C solution from<br>an Advent of Code puzzle as such. And I got a little clumsy there.<br>Actually, chatGPT says that it has no access to the internet and is somewhere at the level of 2021.<br>And this puzzle is from December 4th this year, just a few days before writing the<br>actual script. So if anyone knows what happened and how it works, always get on with it.<br>Eighth, have configuration files created. chatGPT also speaks<br>Docker by the way. Here is an example of a Docker file for WordPress.<br>Also Docker Compose is no problem. Even volumes are used and<br>worked with environment variables. So no basic stuff.<br>Ninth, security tips. Even if you ask the AI for IT security tips,<br>the most important options actually come out. However, the AI recommends<br>changing passwords regularly, which is controversial. But rules for a firewall<br>are also spitting chatGPT out sensibly. No real rules, of course, but sensible guidelines.<br>Tenth, employee care. You want to throw a New Year's party with nerds,<br>make employees familiar with each other, plan a cool business event.<br>The AI also provides a lot of ideas for this. My favorite, have a nerd karaoke night.<br>Danger and benefits. You see, this thing is your personal stack overflow,<br>which always responds directly and does not shame you. But I see a very important problem<br>that chatGPT even points out at the start page. Apart from all the other things<br>like copyright etc. The correctness. Yes, I can now use an AI to generate code, tests and<br>documentation. For the light problems, this works really well.<br>For complex tasks, it will probably work brilliantly when it comes out of the beta.<br>I give the whole thing a maximum of a handful of years, but there is still a problem.<br>We developers and IT people must not be lazy. Our problems are sometimes incredibly specific<br>and we cannot leave it entirely to an AI. But we also see that AI sometimes comes up with solutions<br>that we may not even have on the screen. We should not be afraid to<br>accept our toolset, because it is so powerful that it can change our entire workflow<br>and that is positive. But we should not forget that as human programmers,<br>this tool also makes mistakes. I see that the work of developers and IT people is<br>increasingly taking on a management role. More communication, understanding what is<br>required at all, understanding how to divide a complex problem into its subproblems.<br>The AI does not take that away from you. Nevertheless, I am particularly afraid of managers or<br>bosses who suddenly think they can do everything themselves and simply get<br>some hosting materials created by chatGPT. They will have IT security problems<br>and not just that, I promise you. You always need a person who knows<br>their area really well. But one thing is for sure, an excuse why you don't write me any tests<br>anymore, you don't have them anymore. Bonus I already have so many ideas what I can do with<br>this AI. In the coming year I will implement some videos with it. You can be<br>curious. But since that is mostly content for my other channels, here again<br>the call to subscribe to it. Also look past the stream on Friday at 2 pm, maybe you will<br>even find a question that was asked by this AI. But don't worry, you can't cheat,<br>unless you can really, really quickly. I wish the other one a Merry Christmas and a<br>great start to the new year. My last video this year will be on the other channel on the 23rd.<br>Between the years I also take a break. Take a break and come back to the new year.

their AI tool<br>and in this video I'm kind of borrowing<br>this idea from somebody who did it on<br>Twitter they did a Twitter thread and I<br>thought you know what that's really<br>interesting so I might just do it on my<br>YouTube channel why not uh hopefully I'm<br>not the only one that thinks it's<br>interesting and I'm gonna ask it I'm<br>gonna have a conversation with AI<br>however that works I'm going to ask it<br>basically how can I make money online in<br>2023 you know I only know what I know<br>um but I'm faced with my human<br>limitations so let's see what the uh the<br>best AI tool out there that I'm aware of<br>is going to tell me to do so I can<br>increase my online passive income in<br>2023.<br>foreign<br>guys so I'm on openai.com you may have<br>caught my previous videos where I used<br>their older AI tool and I allowed it to<br>basically provide me Niche ideas for<br>various print-on-demand designs for<br>instance if I wanted to uh make a design<br>with a lake on it and then say hey can<br>you create me a list of all the biggest<br>lakes in the United States it would do<br>that for me so the chat GPT I think is<br>meant to be more conversational so why<br>don't I ask it um<br>have any ideas on how I can make money<br>online<br>and it says there are many ways to make<br>money online and the specific method you<br>choose will depend on your skills<br>interests and the amount of time you<br>have available here are a few ideas to<br>get you started one start a blog or<br>website if you have a passion for a<br>particular subject you can start a blog<br>or website where you share your<br>knowledge and experiences with others<br>you can earn money through advertising<br>sponsorships and affiliate marketing I<br>actually do have my blog already<br>reinhoge.com if you guys didn't know<br>that and I have another website that I<br>made over a decade ago that still brings<br>in some advertising and direct<br>sponsorship money as well<br>so I like that idea I can I can<br>definitely get behind that<br>two sell products or Services if you<br>have a skill or Talent you can use the<br>internet to sell products or services to<br>customers this could include things like<br>handmade crafts<br>artwork photography or Consulting<br>Services hey another great tip and I<br>think I technically am doing that as<br>well I sell products I have my FBA<br>business my print on demand business and<br>I do sell some services like Consulting<br>for instance uh you know there's always<br>a link in the description<br>three complete online surveys many<br>companies are willing to pay for<br>Consumer feedback and insights you can<br>sign up to participate in online surveys<br>and earn money in your spare time and<br>that's another good tip I don't know if<br>I would recommend it for you guys I used<br>to use this website called Swagbucks<br>Swagbucks and you could do like simple<br>tasks every day and get paid in points<br>and then redeem the points for Amazon<br>gift cards and you could also like run<br>these apps on your phone that just ran<br>ads all the time so I bought like five<br>little smartphones and just kept them<br>running ads all day and I was getting<br>like you know Amazon gift cards pretty<br>often so it wasn't a bad deal but I<br>think that was a long time ago probably<br>like six years ago seven years ago so I<br>wouldn't recommend it anymore today but<br>I haven't also really been looking into<br>it the surveys though are very manual<br>process and can take forever so I<br>wouldn't recommend that relative to what<br>you get paid in my experience<br>four offer freelance Services the<br>internet has made it easier than ever<br>for Freelancers to find work in a wide<br>range of fields<br>if you have a specific skill such as<br>writing graphic design or programming<br>you can offer your services to clients<br>online<br>and I mean guys hard to disagree there<br>right hard to disagree you can go to<br>websites like Fiverr and post a gig and<br>name your price and see if people are<br>willing to hire you at that price you<br>know make sure it's worth your time you<br>can go to Craigslist even though<br>Craigslist is more of a local thing you<br>can still I mean I don't know where you<br>guys live but where I live there's<br>millions of people and you can for sure<br>be found selling your services so that's<br>something that is worth considering<br>uh number five invest in the stock<br>market another way to make money online<br>is to invest in the stock market while<br>this option carries a certain amount of<br>risk it can also provide the potential<br>for higher returns if you make smart<br>investment decisions<br>hard to disagree with number five too um<br>when it comes to investing I would<br>probably recommend generally speaking uh<br>keeping it high level probably just<br>invest in index funds there's one called<br>the uh the ticker is spy and it just<br>tracks the S P 500 and it pays a<br>dividend if you are a passive investor<br>then you're not a Trader right you're<br>not trading in and out of positions<br>you're just investing and doing nothing<br>uh you can just go with you know the s p<br>index uh the Spy<br>ETF get paid a dividend as well and it<br>pretty much tracks inflation you know<br>most of the time so you can at least<br>protect your buying power there or you<br>can just buy Apple stock which is<br>literally a two trillion dollar company<br>and if it goes down pretty much the<br>whole world's Financial system will go<br>down so it's pretty much guaranteed to<br>be propped up to a certain extent uh and<br>they'll have to intervene if anything<br>crazy happens all right there's a try<br>again button why don't we track that or<br>try that and see if they come up with<br>like a different response here<br>um I haven't gone too in depth with my<br>usage of this tool<br>and it looks like it's struggling to<br>respond so maybe we even just<br>um hit refresh how can I what should we<br>say we should say something about print<br>on demand is<br>it worth starting a print on demand<br>business is it worth starting a<br>print-on-demand business what do you<br>guys think the AI will say<br>starting a print-on-demand business can<br>be a great way to sell products without<br>having to invest in inventory or<br>fulfillment however as with any business<br>it's important to carefully consider the<br>potential challenges and opportunities<br>before making the decision to start one<br>some things to consider include the<br>potential competition in the market the<br>costs of setting up and running the<br>business and the potential demand for<br>your products it's also important to<br>have a solid business plan in place and<br>to be prepared to put in the work and<br>effort required to make the business<br>successful overall whether or not<br>starting a print-on-demand business is<br>worth it will depend on your individual<br>circumstances and goals<br>yeah it's a good response it's also such<br>a nuanced you know response where<br>they're kind of just like it could be<br>good it could be bad you know worry<br>about a business plan think about your<br>Market you know it's good advice I guess<br>but it's also very um high level about<br>as high level as it could possibly be<br>all right I guess if you ask it the<br>wrong question it just gets hung up<br>because I've gotten hung up the last<br>couple times I've tried to uh request<br>some T-shirt design ideas t-shirt niches<br>so why don't we try this one more time<br>I'm gonna say I'd like to sell<br>t-shirts online what<br>uh can you provide a list of of shirt<br>Niche ideas question mark please answer<br>sure here are a few t-shirt Niche ideas<br>thank you uh first sports teams fans<br>love to show their support for their<br>favorite teams so t-shirts with team<br>logos or slogans could be popular<br>obviously as the uh YouTuber here I have<br>to say that there are restrictions on<br>what we're allowed to sell you don't<br>want to commit intellectual property<br>infringement so be careful there<br>pop culture t-shirts with references to<br>popular TV shows movies or memes could<br>be a hit with fans of those things so<br>same thing kind of applies there<br>Hobbies if you're passionate about a<br>particular hobby like gardening or<br>hiking you could create t-shirts with<br>designs related to that Hobby<br>social causes t-shirts with slogans or<br>designs related to social causes like<br>environmentalism or mental health<br>awareness could be a great way to spread<br>awareness and support those causes<br>humor funny t-shirts with clever jokes<br>or puns can be a hit with people looking<br>for a good laugh and I have to say yes<br>humorous designs are the way to go and<br>somehow some way the AI<br>it knew to suggest humor now I don't<br>know if it understands what the word<br>humor or funny means or you know<br>contextually if it could detect it but<br>uh it's definitely I would say I can I<br>can definitely agree with the humorous<br>shirts<br>uh it said geography t-shirts with City<br>or Regional landmarks or slogans can be<br>popular with people from that area or<br>who have visited there so it understands<br>context at least with geography<br>and last it says art if you're an artist<br>you could create t-shirts featuring your<br>own artwork<br>these are just a few ideas to get you<br>started the best Niche for you will<br>depend on your interests and what you<br>think will sell well so it is<br>interesting that it does leave it kind<br>of like Dynamic uh it's almost like it<br>understands that it's not like a<br>one-size-fits-all fits-all response when<br>it uh responds to us so this is pretty<br>cool guys um let me know if you have any<br>other ideas for what I should be asking<br>the uh the AI tool or you know the the<br>magic AI Genie here<br>um what's the all right on the way out I<br>don't know if it's gonna answer it but<br>what's what will the best selling<br>t-shirt Niche idea of 2023 be and I'm<br>assuming it's not going to answer so<br>I'll wrap the video up as I wait yeah it<br>doesn't look like it's gonna know<br>um because I don't know if they've<br>advertised the AI for being able to<br>predict the future but it would be cool<br>oh no here it goes wait what<br>I'm sorry I'm not able to browse the<br>internet or predict future Trends all<br>right all right it cannot predict the<br>future<br>yet<br>um guys let me know if you enjoyed

Let's dive in! <br>Chat  GPT is a language model developed by OpenAI, <br>specifically trained for interactions by conversation. <br>You can ask questions to Chat GPT and chat with it. <br>It also can code, fix bugs, write articles, help you decorate your home, makeup recipes, and more. <br>Chat GPT was fine-tuned on top of GPT-3.5 using supervised learning and reinforcement learning. <br>Okay. We learned briefly what Chat GPT is. <br>Let's take a look at how we can use Chat GPT for data science projects.  <br>Data visualization is one of the best ways \n",
              "to understand data. <br>Seaborn is often used for statistical data visualization.   <br>We can use Chat GPT for data visualization. Let's ask  <br>Chat GPT to draw a box plot with Seaborn. \n",

              "request to the website and store the response.  <br>Next, it said to parse the HTML content. <br>And then find all book elements on the page. <br>Lastly,  it gave codes to print the information for each book. <br>This is amazing. <br>To try these codes,  <br>let's copy these codes and then paste them into this cell. <br>Let's run this cell. <br>As you can see,  <br>we have scraped the book names and prices on the site. <br>So we collected data easily from a website with Chat GPT.   <br>Lastly, we want to show you how to build a machine-learning model.   <br>Machine learning is a subfield of AI and aims to automatically develop models using data. <br>We can also build machine learning models with Chat GPT.  <br>Now let's create a logistic regression model with the iris dataset.   <br>Let's say hey Chat GPT,   <br>load the iris dataset with sci-kit-learn and then<br>build a logistic regression model to predict \n",
              "iris flower species with Python.<br> Look at that,  <br>Chat GPT started to show codes to predict iris flower species. <br>This is perfect. <br>Let's copy these codes and paste them into our notebook.  <br>Let's run this cell. <br>As you can see, the model has 100% accuracy on the test set.  <br>That's it. Thanks for watching. <br>In this video, I show you how to use Chat GPT for your data science projects. <br>I hope you enjoy it.

fetched</td></tr><tr><td>mhN_hFVUgsQ</td><td>hey it's Tim here today I want to talk<br>about AI chat jbt and tablet it's been<br>in the headlines for the last month I<br>finally think formed an opinion on this<br>and so here I am to share it with you as<br>ever let's get started okay so by no<br>doubt you will have heard of a tool<br>called chat GPT this is me logged into<br>it already if you haven't this is<br>probably going to blow your mind so<br>pause this video go and check out this<br>talk ask it some questions and discover<br>what it's made of in this video what I<br>want to do is specifically focus in on<br>how this kind of Technology could help<br>disrupt or even Aid Tableau and or<br>people using tablet in the future and so<br>as a very simple task what you could do<br>is you go to chat DPT and ask it what is<br>Tableau that's a very simple question<br>what chargpt has done in the past is<br>it's gone on and done a bit of machine<br>learning on a corpus of Data Corpus of<br>data is just basically like a folder<br>full of information and has gained that<br>in 2021 I believe and has gone out and<br>sourced information from the internet<br>and it's used that information to build<br>what is essentially a statistic model of<br>speech and language that then enables it<br>to responds to question based on the<br>information that it has so it's not<br>actually built a Knowledge Graph it's<br>built a statistical model of how<br>language comes together alongside<br>specific topics and questions and that's<br>how it's responding and so here you get<br>a response that is for all intensive<br>purposes good enough for the everyday<br>person one paragraph straight explainer<br>perfect what you can then start to do is<br>ask it a little bit more complex things<br>so for example how do I connect<br>snowflake in Tableau and it's even able<br>to sort of work through typos or things<br>that you get wrong and it will give you<br>a step-by-step instruction on how to use<br>those two technologies to begin together<br>and more often than not this comes back<br>99 of the time correct and so this is a<br>really really good way of kind of using<br>this tool as a conversational assistance<br>the other thing I think this tool does<br>really well is you can ask follow-on<br>questions for example<br>um how would I set up that connection<br>with more security so what I've done<br>here is I've asked I've asked the chat<br>GPT to essentially Carry On from where<br>it's left with that particular question<br>and I can just say well how do I add<br>more security to that connection and so<br>here there are a few key ways you can<br>set up more secure connects with your<br>tablet and snowflake use a secure<br>connection original let's wait for the<br>Second Step here use a private Network<br>um if you're using a private node to<br>connect to Tableau something like a VPN<br>then people can't sort of Snoop on your<br>conversation use level level security<br>that's specifically looking at the<br>actual data that you're getting access<br>to I use single sign-on to sign into<br>Snowflake and Tableau so things a little<br>bit better and so as a conversational<br>tool I think this is fantastic because<br>you can get deeper into a topic asking<br>sort of one sentence at a time to get<br>your better understanding of a<br>particular topic and I think this is<br>actually the best way to use this I can<br>almost imagine this as a conversational<br>AI in your ear with a with an airport or<br>something you just talking out loud and<br>something sort of telling you how it<br>works a bit like the film her I don't<br>know if you've watched it if you haven't<br>that's a great film you should go watch<br>to me this kind of technology is almost<br>in that realm it's really really good<br>and it starts to fall over when you get<br>into sort of more complex questions for<br>example how would you<br>configure a snowflake driver for Tableau<br>server okay so there's a definitely<br>going to be some typos in there to<br>configure snowflake drive for tablet<br>server follow these steps download the<br>snowflake adbc driver install the adpc<br>driver and it goes through the steps and<br>you can essentially get to a point where<br>it essentially trips up on some of these<br>steps and it tries to give instructions<br>on how to do things now in this in this<br>particular set of instructions it's made<br>an assumption that I'm using Tableau<br>server for Windows in order to do this<br>and um the other interesting thing is as<br>it gets more and more complex and more<br>complex questions you ask it there's a<br>higher risk that one of these points is<br>not actually factually correct but<br>actually still doing a pretty good job<br>of detailing out everything I need to<br>know to bring these two capabilities<br>together and it just keeps on going and<br>in essence if you don't know anything<br>about this topic what I always say is<br>the more it gives you the more rest that<br>the something is wrong and you're going<br>to make a mistake so you do actually<br>need to know this topic well in order to<br>actually make use of this which makes it<br>pointless because if you know this topic<br>well why would you come here to<br>understand how it works that's where<br>this sort of tool falls down and I think<br>it's a very interesting capability but<br>it's got its own sort of words of<br>caution but that doesn't mean I don't<br>think it's useful I'll come back to that<br>point a little later on<br>what I want to move on to next is how is<br>this technology going to work inside of<br>tablet and the answer is it's already<br>working inside a tablet if I go over to<br>the tablets page for AI and analytics<br>you can see they have a page already<br>that talks about this so I want I'd love<br>to know the web analytics behind this<br>particular page in the last month has it<br>gone up have people searched for these<br>two topics on this page come up at the<br>top I wonder but tablet actually themes<br>its Ai and capabilities in three general<br>areas augmented analytics business<br>science and data science probably worth<br>mentioning a a distinction between the<br>term Ai and machine learning and at this<br>point it's probably worth sort of just<br>highlighting why those two things are<br>different the key thing is machine<br>learning is a discipline inside of ai ai<br>is the broad Umbrellas of everything<br>that happens inside of a particular<br>discipline so in this case it could be<br>machine learning it could be predictive<br>modeling all of those things sit under<br>the AI banner and so Tableau has three<br>broad areas and if you scroll down it<br>actually spells out what those three<br>broad areas mean so the first one is<br>augmented analytics which means ask data<br>and explain data two very cool tools I<br>always think actually our state is<br>missing a trip our state should stop<br>trying to teach you how to use tablet by<br>showing you the pills the fields and<br>everything and should just give you what<br>you want the chart itself let you ask<br>questions let you build shots maybe even<br>suggest shots it thinks you should see<br>based on what you're asking explain data<br>is far more useful this basically looks<br>into a data set and tries to spot any<br>anomalies that are maybe either related<br>to that specific data point or<br>statistical variances in the whole<br>spread of the data it's actually a<br>pretty good tool that doing that and<br>helps people just discover those<br>insights they maybe weren't aware of<br>if we go down to business science this<br>is where I think this this sort of area<br>starts to become more a little bit um<br>hard to understand because you know<br>tablet have all these marketing terms<br>simple fast trusted integrated but when<br>you go down it talks about forecasting<br>it talks about predictive modeling<br>functions but at the same time business<br>science has been used in a bunch of<br>capabilities that relate to Einstein<br>analytics it used to be called Anson<br>analytics it's now called Tableau<br>business science and it's gone on and<br>changed names a few more times but in<br>essence uh it talks here about<br>forecasting and predictive modeling<br>which are strictly disciplines in AI but<br>they're not typically what people think<br>about when you're using Ai and these<br>this in this sort of use case you have<br>to know a lot about statistical modeling<br>to really go and use these or trust<br>these tools entirely and the very last<br>area is data science this is of course<br>giving people the ability to connect<br>their own machine learning models or<br>their own AI to table ions so here<br>you've got our python Matlab and<br>analytics extensions API these are all<br>ways of bring bringing that intelligence<br>into the platform and then using it to<br>work better so it's actually really nice<br>to tablet have this page I'm going to<br>link it in the description so you can go<br>check it out<br>but um I hinted earlier that in my<br>opinion this is just one way the tablet<br>could be using this um information they<br>could be using this technology to help<br>people and I think it makes sense from a<br>product perspective tablet have this<br>challenge where you know the early<br>adopters of Tableau were the people who<br>built dashboards are the people who go<br>out and build<br>um tools and things that people use<br>for them to get over that hump to get<br>the mass adoption to really go viral<br>something as viral as Excel to where<br>everyone knows what it is and knows how<br>to use it they really have to go to a<br>much much simpler user base and in order<br>to do that you can't expect them to be<br>opening up<br>um Tableau and doing data models that's<br>almost a step too far and businesses<br>just haven't opened up their data stages<br>and their data warehouses to people in<br>that way and so Tableau have to use Ai<br>and machine learning to surface insights<br>on behalf of people to get them using<br>the tool better and that's sort of one<br>approach they've taken<br>but I still fundamentally believe that<br>actually you can use Ai and machine<br>learning capabilities to help people<br>discover the tool better and this is<br>sort of a nuanced thing so bear with me<br>you see when we were sitting here asking<br>it questions this data was trained on a<br>corpus that was just scanned from the<br>internet a long time ago and the way<br>that chat GPT specifically the company<br>behind chat jbt openai have done this is<br>they took a technology that was actually<br>released last year called gpt3 and they<br>combined it with human input so<br>essentially they had people who were<br>editing the input and the style and the<br>responses as they came across it and<br>they did this on mass scale there's<br>actually an academic paper which I'll<br>link to that you can go check out that<br>talks about this and that's what's made<br>it a really really good tool now<br>essentially they've trained it on what<br>is a broad Corpus of data about the<br>world and it's coming back with very<br>good responses the flip side is you<br>could train this on a very specific set<br>of data and you could end up getting<br>really really valuable outputs out of<br>the system even though<br>um it maybe doesn't necessarily know<br>about things that might be new or might<br>be coming up in the future and so that's<br>where I've got the tablet help and the<br>tablet Community because if I just you<br>know restrict the scope to just what<br>Tabla has access to they've got all the<br>help documentation going back I don't<br>know how many versions<br>and the great thing about those is<br>they're version specific so you could<br>actually very easily have<br>um Tableau explain something in<br>different versions if you go out and you<br>train your own model on this specific<br>Corpus of information essentially all<br>the help documentation that you've put<br>together to help people better use the<br>tool this is a highly underused resource<br>people never really find it and what you<br>tend to find is when you go to the<br>tablet knowledge base they're linking<br>back to the help documentation when you<br>look in the tablet forums they're also<br>linking back to this and that's sort of<br>bringing me to the second data set which<br>is this the tablet Community pages also<br>have tons of questions and tons of<br>different things that people have asked<br>alongside the answers and the things<br>they're linking to so you could also use<br>that information as a way of building a<br>model for the way people are finding<br>problems and the answers that are<br>solving those problems and pairing those<br>two things you could maybe build<br>something a little bit more intelligent<br>than just ask data and explain data<br>which is instead of helping people see<br>better insights instead help people use<br>the tool better they can get to those<br>insights faster<br>it's a completely different Paradigm but<br>it's more of an educative sort of<br>approach and it's something I think<br>we've lost touch of in more recent times<br>back when I was young Microsoft Word had<br>a tool called clappy and clippy would<br>help you understand how to use Microsoft<br>Word you go to Clipper you ask it how to<br>do something and it would tell you<br>here's how to do it and it would point<br>you to the right section of the software<br>we've lost that sort of finesse in more<br>recent times with technology because I<br>think smartphones and tablets have sort<br>of forced people to make UI and<br>Technology much much simpler and that's<br>good because it makes it more accessible<br>but then it also means the capability is<br>a really powerful capabilities are<br>pushed off to the fringes and I think<br>that happens with Tableau a lot I can't<br>tell you how many people just aren't<br>aware of certain features that are<br>deployed and live right now inside of<br>tablet just the other week I actually<br>met someone who asked why is it so hard<br>to do year-on-year comparisons with<br>Tableau and in about three clicks I went<br>ahead and I show them how to do it now<br>they didn't know that the approach I<br>took was actually possible because they<br>didn't know you could create an ad hoc<br>calculation very easily to just change<br>the number from being a minus 1 to being<br>a minus 12 because we had months in the<br>view and year um we had months in the<br>view and then profit on the axis and<br>basically we're just looking at euron<br>year sales broken down by month and I<br>just changed the lookup to basically<br>look back 12 months and create a<br>duplicate of the view and there we had<br>it we had a year on year comparison and<br>you could then do difference and a bunch<br>of other things from there on using<br>percentages as well<br>and when I showed it to them they found<br>that approach easy but what they were<br>comparing it to is power bi which had<br>something baked in already and they were<br>actually comfortable doing it the more<br>complicated way if they knew it was as<br>easy as I made it look and so this is<br>where I think Tableau really could use<br>this tool use it to help surface better<br>ways of using the product hey you've<br>just created a join but we think the<br>exact same thing as a data model would<br>actually perform better and here's why<br>then an introduction to the model and<br>just have this AI paying attention to<br>what's going on in the software how<br>you're using the software how you're<br>browsing the software they already have<br>this capability in taboo server which<br>looks at what other people are using<br>that are similar to you and they're<br>surfacing that to you as recommendations<br>it's exactly the same thing but this<br>time you're actually helping people<br>better use the software and so I think<br>that's an area that could work really<br>really well the copyright issues are<br>endless if you're not tablet and you're<br>thinking of doing this I'd recommend you<br>to just do this with your own data set<br>which in my case is going to be the<br>translations of the video into text<br>essentially so going and getting the<br>audio uh transcribing the whole lot but<br>it's not going to be a very useful data<br>set because it's all conversation<br>there's no sort of instructional element<br>to it blogs on the other hand are a very<br>good they say if you've been writing<br>blogs for the last decade now is the<br>time to see if you can train an<br>artificial intelligence store to go and<br>maybe surface this in a way that works<br>that surfaces your blogs to people in a<br>much better way the other thing is if<br>you've created a lot of blogs over the<br>last few years it's probably worth<br>putting a copyright notice on the bottom<br>of your blog just so that when an AI or<br>tool comes to take a corpus of your blog<br>without your permission at least you<br>have some sort of protection for when<br>these tools then do fall under sort of a<br>legal Mandate of some sort because at<br>the moment it's just a free-for-all and<br>the tools just seem to be carrying out<br>and scraping whatever they want because<br>it's the internet and open internet so<br>um yeah those are my thoughts on this<br>issue it's a very nuanced issue I'd be<br>really intrigued to see where else it<br>goes but for me personally I think the<br>most useful area is just this stuff uh<br>there's so many simple things in Tableau<br>that this tool could already do today<br>you could already ask it how to do them<br>and it would already go off and explain<br>them I can't tell you how many how many<br>simple things for example<br>um how do I build a bar chart in tableau<br>I've made a two minute video on this so<br>hopefully you'd find my video and go and<br>watch it but here to build a bar chart<br>and Tableau follow these steps open<br>tablane connect your data great drag and<br>measure fields to column shelf and the<br>dimension fill to the row shelf it's<br>even specifically telling you which<br>shaft that is for example if you want to<br>create a bar chart showing the cells by<br>region you would drag the sales measure<br>to the column stuff and the region<br>dimensions of the row Shelf in the marks<br>card select bar as a mark type telling<br>you to go to the marks card if you want<br>to customize the appearance of the bar<br>chart you can then use the options in<br>the marks card to change the color size<br>and other visual properties for the buzz<br>if you want to add labels go ahead you<br>can also use the options in the columns<br>and row shelf to customize the axis for<br>your bar chart for example you can<br>change the number format axis title and<br>other options once you've finished<br>building your bar chart you can then use<br>the options in the worksheet tab to<br>customize the appearance of the chart<br>and titles and captions and save before<br>you publish your work<br>if you knew nothing about Tableau tell<br>me that isn't a much better description<br>than just going off to Google and trying<br>to find the right help and then ending<br>up stuck in a bunch of resources if you<br>don't understand any of the terms you<br>can always go ahead and follow that up<br>so you can say hey what is the marks<br>Shelf<br>and it understands you're talking about<br>Tableau and it will just go ahead and<br>tell you Intel Bay the markshop is the<br>visual element that you can use to<br>customize the appearance of behavior the<br>mark shelf is located in the marks card<br>which is found in the lower right corner<br>of the Tableau interface the lower right<br>corner of the tablet emphasize<br>oh interesting that's technically wrong<br>but I know what it's referring to it in<br>the Tableau interface there is nothing<br>on the lower right corner it all stops<br>like on the left hand side but it means<br>the most lower right thing in the<br>Tableau interface so in that respect<br>maybe the language isn't great it needs<br>to be able to just show you images and<br>you can go off to to Google and set it<br>up but it gives you an explanation okay<br>um you can also ask it where let's see<br>let's ask where is the columns Shelf<br>okay and again it understands it it<br>worked through my typo in the in Tableau<br>the column shelf is a visual element<br>that you can use to specify<br>um what to include in as columns in your<br>visualization the column shelf is<br>located in the top left corner of the<br>top table interface next to the row<br>shaft so that is actually correct<br>um and then again it gives you a little<br>bit more detail and you can go off and<br>and use it so<br>if you're new to Tableau and you're<br>stuck you don't understand how to do<br>something<br>I think more often than not this tool is<br>going to give you the right answers and<br>if you combine that with your research<br>skills and your ability to deduce<br>information from the help documentation<br>alongside the internet just doing basic<br>research Googling I can't see how you<br>would go wrong and understanding how to<br>do something yes you might get stuck you<br>might not know exactly what you're<br>trying to do you might not know exactly<br>what data set you're working with but at<br>least when it comes to the realm of just<br>understanding how to do something or<br>knowing where there's knowledge gaps<br>that you need to go off and investigate<br>I think this is a fantastic tool and I<br>can't see why people won't be using this<br>more to help them get their work done<br>faster so they can achieve what they're<br>trying to achieve and do less of messing<br>around with tools and software that<br>frankly don't matter because when the<br>Insight is what you're trying to get to<br>that's the only thing that matters and<br>therefore that's pretty much the<br>anything you remember in the entire<br>workflow three four years down the line<br>when you've forgotten all this stuff the<br>Insight is still what you'll have in<br>your mind so maybe tablets should just<br>spend more time making it until

And here we are, right now.<br> And that's why we're just going to digress from this conversation, because everyone needs to know now.<br> This changes everything.<br> From today, basically.<br> From today, yes.<br> Already three days after it was launched.<br> And this is cool.<br> And what is so cool now?<br> We just talked about something that changes everything.<br> What do you mean everything?<br> What is everything now, Johan?<br> Everything. Question. What is everything?<br> Ask this all-knowing machine what everything is.<br> We are talking about OpenAI's GPT-3, which has been released for a while, but has been updated.<br> Yes, and a short story, and we can ask some more specific questions, we were just talking about this before, you and Johan,<br> and we thought we should do some research here, so we can make some statements and such, and you were like \"no, we're going to do it, we have AI,<br> we can actually use it, so we thought we would do it that way\", but a very short story is that we have OpenAI,<br> It's a foundation that was started by Elon Musk, you can check my facts here.<br> About 7 years ago.<br> They have delivered a couple of different language models, it's been going pretty fast this year.<br> A couple of years ago, GPT-2 was released.<br> And when this came, it was open sourced in a smaller model,<br> where they kept the larger model of GPT-2 behind an API.<br> Just because there were articles already two years ago<br> that this is so powerful that it is possible to do some malicious things with this.<br> You could get a...<br> Well, you think that you are now doing bad things.<br> You could get a white power association and start writing really good texts about how you can do bad things with the world.<br> You could think that the spam bots would be much more intelligent.<br> You don't need a lot of imagination to come up with bad things in MIA.<br> So that's why they chose not to open source this whole model and put it out there.<br> So that's been behind an API.<br> And it's been closed for most people for a long time.<br> They've had a research channel in, where they've been able to apply for access to this.<br> And in the summer, somewhere, they opened up GPT-3 to start playing with it.<br> And then something happened, just \"bang\".<br> Someone on Twitter wrote that it was like an atomic bomb that had hit the earth.<br> I think this is a good analogy, because something big is happening here.<br> Let's go straight to the point, I can show you here, because you asked me to fact check,<br> so I asked if Elon Musk started up an AI, and it wasn't really like that,<br> it was a group of investors and researchers, including Elon Musk,<br> who started this from the beginning, so we shouldn't give all the cred to this one.<br> And we saw a preview of this, this is what was released this Friday, this chat API, or completely open chat.<br> Because it is enough to have an account on OpenAI to access this.<br> Yes, exactly, and at the moment this is free.<br> It's also a pretty cool thing, I would say that they have actually made this open to the whole world.<br> So this chat at openai.com is open and free.<br> Let's look at how it can also look like. This is just another view of where we use the same model.<br> And there they have a playground, an openai. It's still the same domain and the same login if you were to get it.<br> You have the option to choose different models and you don't need to know a lot of technical details.<br> If you write something, you will get an answer.<br> \"May you write a web app in Python using Flask?\"<br> We can see what the answer is.<br> And now it's fun if we get an answer too.<br> With the risk that it's a bit slow right now, because we've noticed that the Americans have woken up now when we're doing this recording.<br> and then this might go a bit slower, because there is a lot of pressure on this one.<br> Yes, a lot of pressure.<br> So here you get some instructions for how to...<br> What is the general workflow here?<br> And I suspect here now, now I can't do this borderline so well,<br> but you could perhaps develop number one here,<br> how do you actually do it?<br> And that's where I think the strength is in this chat GPT.<br> Because this, I think it's in the same model behind these,<br> But if we look at the chat interface, if you ask the same question, for example<br> If we throw up... Oh, I was the one who clicked at the same time as you<br> Yes, then we test... What did you say now?<br> Write a web app in Python<br> Using Flask, is that what you said?<br> Yes<br> Let's start like that.<br> Oh, I even got some code here.<br> Exactly.<br> So we don't get the same answers, and that's cool, because it's not deterministic in that way.<br> We don't get the same answer for the same question all the time.<br> It's always different.<br> And of course, this can be very useful.<br> I've started to work on this, I'm thinking of my role as a teacher now<br> to be able to use this to generate tasks.<br> If you also have an API, you can make sure that each student gets unique tasks<br> but with the same degree of difficulty and the same general problem setting, for example.<br> And if you were to take this one step further,<br> because that's why we're sitting here, I mean, this was perhaps the least fun example we could start with.<br> I'm sorry, I'm sorry.<br> I'm the first one to come up.<br> But if we move on, I've switched to my screen.<br> I asked what's the story behind GPT-Free.<br> This is a language model,<br> and you have to be aware that that's what it's made for.<br> But if we take a more creative example,<br> what can we do with this?<br> That's also it.<br> This bomb that has been put down.<br> I want to claim this, and I might make a tough claim.<br> I, as a teacher at Linné University, an examiner, and I teach.<br> This affects so much now that from now on I don't see how we can<br> implement some type of submission tasks via submissions in the way we did before.<br> I'm not saying that this tool is wrong, I'm for these tools, I think it's good for humanity.<br> But the way we examine and have done it, we have to rethink it completely.<br> It can be a take away if you look at this, and you're a teacher,<br> really think about what kind of entry task it is.<br> - Can you problematize? - You can reset it for safety.<br> It's a bit like this, you should be aware of it, it remembers the whole conversation.<br> So it will reconnect to what you have talked about earlier.<br> So it can be good to start over.<br> And now you choose to speak Swedish here. Problematize.<br> - Can you create a school? - Yes, we can start like that.<br> - From a societal perspective. - Yes.<br> We'll try.<br> Oh my god.<br> And here we get a very...<br> For our tool it writes very good Swedish.<br> It's a little worse, I can experience, in Swedish than what I experienced it was in English.<br> But it's very, very good.<br> This actually sounds like a fairly neutral text.<br> Can't we work on this a little?<br> Yes, exactly. We can do that.<br> Write it as a poem by... Do we have any...<br> Karin Boye, let's go.<br> No, she's not. He couldn't do it.<br> Write a poem by Karin Boye.<br> I actually tested this one the day before.<br> But, Stava Boye in that way?<br> I think so.<br> IE, I think that's why she didn't find anyone.<br> [Silence]<br> - Yes. - Yes.<br> - No. - No.<br> - It was strange, because this worked before. - Yes.<br> - But, write the text as if it were written by a twelve year old.<br> [Silence]<br> And now you're struggling like a 12-year-old too.<br> What a boring introduction we got here now,<br> after being flabbergasted all morning.<br> -What should we do instead? -I'll try to...<br> I'll switch to mine, because I'll try to write an essay on the First World War.<br> And you should be aware that, again, this essay we're getting here<br> It has never existed in this way before.<br> We can take the opinions here, but we won't find them here.<br> So if we have any plagiarism control, it won't take it.<br> \"Write this as if a twelve-year-old...\"<br> \"...had written the text.\"<br> For me, it worked. I don't know why.<br> But what you see here is that you get a completely different usage of language.<br> Which is much simpler, shorter sentences.<br> Use a different language here. \"The war was very tough and many soldiers and civilians died.\"<br> That sounds like a 12 year old would have written that.<br> This text up here, you could have seen it.<br> Do you think there's a 12 year old who's using this right now? On a task?<br> I wouldn't be surprised by that.<br> I think we should just assume that everyone is using this.<br> It would be weird if people didn't.<br> So from a teacher's perspective, if you have a given task and submit it,<br> you should sit down and try to ask these questions yourself in the AI.<br> And then you realize that it's going to be quite difficult, or even impossible, to actually decide if it's an AI that has written this or if it's the student who has written it.<br> Which means...<br> You start to problematize a bit here and compare with the war in Ukraine, and then we get that in as well.<br> Your AI was a little nicer to you than it was to me here now.<br> Yes, it may have seen through your... you've had some bad intentions or something.<br> Yes, I have tried to use some bad expressions in this. You have that too, right?<br> Yes, but let's try to write about this as a poem by Karin Boje.<br> In the war we killed each other and saw the truth for death and hatred.<br> We believed in our cause and struggle and died in millions for it.<br> But now in retrospect we see that we were blind to our own hatred and betrayal.<br> for what we once called \"victory\".<br> I might not be reading this correctly,<br> I'm not that important.<br> But,<br> but,<br> it's fantastic fun.<br> You can see it's clipping here, I think there's some<br> limitation on the number of characters.<br> But,<br> but,<br> it's very impressive.<br> Fredrik, do you usually<br> hold presentations?<br> It happens that I do.<br> What are you presenting them about?<br> We could say \"Internet of Things\"<br> Is there anything else you want to add?<br> Sustainability<br> Focus on, maybe?<br> Yes<br> And this is pretty cool. Sure, now it's text that you could think of producing yourself, but<br> this is a very specific area, and those who work in this have a good grasp of it, but otherwise not.<br> A powerpoint presentation of this<br> It couldn't do that<br> You can do meeting notes or lecture notes<br> Create presentation notes of what's on the screen<br> We can get some points that we can use to make a PowerPoint presentation.<br> And get some bullet points.<br> And now we're going to do it in Swedish.<br> And I have to say that it's quite fantastic.<br> It took me a whole day to understand that it could speak Swedish.<br> It's not like the documentation said that it could speak Swedish.<br> This is a model that I've trained on a lot of texts on the internet.<br> And this is also pretty cool, this is a model that is trained on a lot of text.<br> It is not trained on a single language, but on many different languages, so it can many different languages.<br> So you can write translations to English.<br> And here, exactly.<br> And...<br> Ehm...<br> Ehm...<br> What's the name of that language?<br> Coconominomomom... What's it called?<br> The fox language?<br> Fox language.<br> That would be fun if it could.<br> Have you tried it?<br> No, I haven't.<br> Oh well.<br> Let's see...<br> Internet of Things here.<br> It wanted to talk about what the \"red-man\" language was for those who were unaware.<br> This is quite fantastic. You thought it was really fun.<br> - Oh, what's happening here? - We have a lot of interlude.<br> Just to show. It's possible to write the \"red-man\" language here with AIN.<br> And we're still speaking Swedish here.<br> And of the things we've been going through here now, when we've been able to test this during the weekend,<br> The problem is that the Swedish language is more limited.<br> Sometimes you get some...<br> What should I say? Some language errors.<br> I think that one of the examples that appeared here before was \"en\" instead of \"ett\"<br> He saw it a bit quickly.<br> And here's a sketch.<br> Aha, so they interpret Swedish Chef as a Swedish chef who speaks Swedish.<br> It's just water in the mix.<br> So here we have a story, we can use this for goodnight stories, we've seen examples of that.<br> You can write...<br> Let's look at the most here.<br> But this tool is here.<br> Yes, and that's why we want to share this information now and here<br> Because it is here now<br> And it wasn't here 3 days ago, when this tool wasn't available<br> And now it's here<br> And that means that in the current situation, depending on what domain you're in<br> In our domain, the data science domain<br> For example, we have programming assignments for our students.<br> First year students and all the way up.<br> And how can such a programming assignment be?<br> It can often be that you are solving a mathematical problem with programming.<br> And if we now try to put in something like this, we could...<br> What do we have now?<br> Do you have a JavaScript example? Like the \"Hello World\" task?<br> Yes, absolutely. We could take \"Write a Hello World\"<br> We can take it in English instead<br> But even more difficult, we can take \"write a v3c\"<br> This is much more advanced then<br> \"write a v3c web component\"<br> \"that shows that\"<br> \"gets the users name\"<br> \"web component that is a login\"<br> \"login form for instance\"<br> We can test that<br> Then we have to find a template code here, first and foremost, for how this login field should look like.<br> With a form, it looks completely correct. It uses the right password with type \"password\".<br> It has a login button. Then it builds a web component.<br> This is a standard web component, not so commonly used.<br> Many users may use React to do this or something else, but this also looks good.<br> On Submit we will receive these parts and then we will have to handle them ourselves.<br> We are not talking about what to do when using another solution, we are just writing to handle this and then define this as a component in the web browser called LoginForm.<br> Then we can use this. So this is even an example of how we could think of using this.<br> Translate<br> So we are going to change this to React code instead<br> I'm not proficient in React, but this looks pretty good<br> It uses JSX instead<br> On the template<br> Nice and pretty, and here I get an example of how I can use this<br> And just to show, while you were doing this, I'm not using the exact same question, I couldn't write it<br> But now I took another one, write a replication as data in a graph<br> And then I get a component here<br> And then I want to change language<br> So I get Python here instead, and now it's not a web application<br> But I can still use this to solve relatively complex programming tasks<br> And you can also break things down into parts.<br> And the cool thing is that you can pick up existing code,<br> paste it in,<br> and then refactor it to make the code better.<br> And it's pretty cool.<br> But now we're talking about computer science.<br> What else do we have?<br> I'll just test one more thing, if you switch over to me.<br> We don't know if this works, but...<br> -And the goal must be... -A course plan for programming.<br> Four exam questions and a clear goal.<br> That's exactly what...<br> \"Basic knowledge in programming and problems with computers.\"<br> \"Learn the basics in Python and Java.\"<br> \"To participate in a program to solve the course content.\"<br> I even get a weekly plan of what we start going through every week.<br> And how the examination should be, four assignments.<br> And then it seems like there is a limit on the number of signs.<br> But then you can split this up and choose to get out sub-goals.<br> Just like this, \"Suggest an examination assignment to the teacher above\".<br> Now it was a little tired. We have seen a little today, as I said, that it has to think a little more sometimes.<br> But the thing is, we've been testing it in the morning.<br> We've tried to write, simply take the university assignment,<br> type it in here and also get it to refer in a correct way.<br> So it creates references to all the statements in the text and so on.<br> Here we even get to start with some headlines too.<br> I don't know what it's doing here, but it generates some assignments for us<br> that we could use in this course<br> I can show you here, I'm asking AI to write a song<br> Blowing in the wind by Bob Dylan, so it's about the future state of AI<br> Here's an example song of Blowing in the wind could be rewritten to be about the future state of AI<br> How many robots must society build? And so on<br> \"Before it's considered advanced\"<br> That's funny<br> I like Rammstein as well<br> And it's also about linguistics<br> \"Write the song Dohast by Rammstein\"<br> I think it's enough to write \"Du hast\" now, because I think that's...<br> I get that. What is it about?<br> Well, what could we talk about? Academic life.<br> You get to go now, because you're German, not my strong side.<br> \"Ich bin\", yes, exactly.<br> I learn, I learn, I learn, I learn every day. You ask, you ask, you ask me always on.<br> But we don't really need to understand this, we can still ask.<br> Right, translate it.<br> And then we can see what we get. And then we get this one.<br> And this is also an example of how we can get AI to be a bit creative.<br> And this is just fantastic fun.<br> It's also a tool that you can have a lot of fun with.<br> You can also write numbers.<br> It's also a thing like that.<br> You can write wagtails and you can write any song you want.<br> And use this.<br> But the big thing here, why we're talking about this, is again the education situation.<br> That if we...<br> Just this, that all types of admission tasks, all types of examination tasks that we do as a kind of admission at a distance,<br> I would like to claim that they become incredibly difficult to examine.<br> If we assume that the students have these tools, we have a problem.<br> If that's what we want to examine.<br> That's the bigger question, Johan.<br> What kind of knowledge do we want to examine?<br> To produce this type of, if it's in code or text, it's relative.<br> It's not strange to use a spelling check in a speech therapist.<br> And it's not spelling we should be correcting.<br> It's about examining the entire submission.<br> It feels like it's getting very difficult.<br> It's about taking this in a different way.<br> Put together students who have had similar tasks.<br> Put them in seminar groups.<br> Be part of an active examination where you are expected to participate.<br> have oral examinations, I think it's very good to have oral examinations and try to have it on as many courses as possible.<br> To talk to the student and use it as a basis for the examination.<br> Is it completely objective at an oral examination?<br> No, maybe not 100%, but I would still say that it is sufficiently objective.<br> If you have a clean entry form and a home tent, you can see the problem here.<br> Otherwise, we will end up in a situation where we have a tent where you sit in a room without any available help.<br> Then you can think that it could work, for now.<br> But, I mean, Elon Musk was there and financed this.<br> We have Neuralink, which he also finances, so who knows how people will be connected in the future.<br> It might be difficult to prevent a tentative...<br> But you're asking AI, of course.<br> Yes, exactly. I'm thinking...<br> I'm asking if we can get a proposal on how we could do examinations when we have an AI here.<br> Automated grading, personal testing, adaptive testing, online proctoring with AI.<br> And I think that if we are to use AI to judge AI,<br> whether it's AI or not, then it's a race all the time.<br> It may not be a successful way, and that's not how we should work.<br> I think we need to take a grip and see what is important for the profession.<br> Because it's cool here now, if we look at what's happening.<br> We can see this from our role as a teacher, the university role.<br> But this is a tool that already changes the game plan for the entire profession.<br> If you work as a communicator and you're going to summarize some kind of text and be creative and such,<br> you can create poems from this. You can do so much with this material.<br> So I think we'll see a lot of things happen very soon.<br> And it's the ones who are late on this technique that end up behind.<br> So we should do everything to promote this technique so that we use it for good.<br> I think it's a must to go in and try it out just to get an idea.<br> Just because you might say, we always require references in our texts, so it's not a big problem.<br> \"I just asked this person to use a reference system on this text that he wrote\"<br> \"and then we get a very nice and nice result\"<br> Now, of course, if you were a student and wanted to use this as plagiarism<br> then I guess that's illegal.<br> I mean, that would be considered as a misleading.<br> But it's still about us having to go through this text<br> and check that these references are actually correct and so on.<br> We have noticed on some questions that it has tried to deceive you<br> So it requires a pretty good insight into the subject to be able to go through those bits.<br> Because it sounds very credible when you read it, but you have to go deep here and actually see.<br> But yes, I expect that it will be used by me today, actually, throughout the entire school system.<br> But a fantastic technique, and it frees, as you are aware of, it frees so much time.<br> Instead of writing boring bread-texts, I can do other things.<br> And just take help from this.<br> I have it open here on the side, on my screen all the time, just to see how I can respond in a friendly way.<br> On this email, for example, that I got here now.<br> And then I can just go in and change some details in there instead of writing.<br> And I know I wrote, it was also such a thing there, we can test it, it's always fun to test it again, but if we think about it now,<br> Write...<br> Write...<br> Tell a patient that is terminally ill and will die within one week<br> only using positive words and with a fun joke.<br> Hi there, I have some great news for you today. You're going to have an amazing week ahead of<br> you. In fact, you are going to have the time of your life. Why was the math book sad? Because<br> \"Because it had too many problems.\"<br> \"So, enjoy your week and don't forget to smile.\"<br> And then it actually says here,<br> \"This approach may not be appropriate for or effective for patients.\"<br> But, it's still like this, I can give it a pretty difficult task here now.<br> You're supposed to tell someone that they're going to die in a week<br> and do it with happy exclamations here now.<br> And, yes, why I took this example, I don't know.<br> But again, just to test the limits of what we can do.<br> Now you came up with something new, Johan.<br> No, I was just thinking about the speech.<br> \"Write a speech for a wedding where my sister gets married. It should be fun.\"<br> It's hard, maybe.<br> I'm trying the same thing at the same time.<br> You wrote in Swedish, right?<br> Hi everyone, welcome to this beautiful world.<br> I'm happy to be here and celebrate my sister and her new husband.<br> I can't... It was supposed to be a husband.<br> I can't let myself think back to all the fun times I've shared with my sister.<br> As children we were always uneducated.<br> We created chaos together.<br> And we haven't grown apart.<br> My sister is the best friend I'll ever have.<br> I'm so happy I've found someone who fits.<br> I'll tell my sisters to not take this as a hint, but just an example.<br> What did you get?<br> I got this, \"Good evening everyone, I'm so happy to celebrate\"<br> \"Proud of my sister, amazing person, beautiful and kind\" and so on.<br> You can have more in English, and then you can rewrite it as a private language.<br> I want you in pirate language, I think this is really fun, because you can get you in pirate language as well.<br> \"Ahoy mateys, I be thrilled to be here today and celebrate the marriage of me, beautiful sister and her new mate. I must admit, I'm a wee bit envious.\"<br> That's a bit...<br> And that's what I love about it, being able to work on it and have it in the conversation, so you can \"rewrite in Irish\" sound.<br> I don't know how this will work at all. I just thought it would be fun to see.<br> But then there are other models. We have DALI, for example, to generate images.<br> There is a system for text and speech that we could feed with this,<br> to then get a realistic reading of this with a Dutch dialect, for example.<br> To create a text that is suitable to be read in Dutch and then we can use it.<br> It became a bit of a macabre example and so on, but really the best way to understand this is to just use the service.<br> And that is chat.openai.com<br> Exactly. Cool!<br> This will lead to many exciting discussions.<br> I see that the academy will be<br> first endangered,<br> but then maybe also see what benefits this can give.<br> And the benefits are both, both disadvantages and benefits are obvious.<br> It is really a revolutionary technique.<br> But you can ask AI to help you with your studies.<br> You can put in some material and ask it to make flashcards for study, and it will generate it.<br> You can use it as a study tool, and it's a very powerful personal tool,<br> where you can sit and use it as...<br> You don't use Google, you ask an AI,<br> which gives an answer based on previous context as well.<br> As long as you have this thread open.<br> When you press \"reset thread\" or \"log out\" it disappears.<br> But it's not far-fetched to think that this AI will still adapt to your previous history and that it will be connected to you.<br> And if we talk about power, transparency and society,<br> then this is a technique that exists here.<br> And regardless of whether it would be shut down,<br> we all know that it exists.<br> And the next question is, who is going to own this technology?<br> Imagine if you, for the last 10 years, only you Johan, had access to this.<br> No one else in the world. You would have had this as a personal AI.<br> You would have been very effective. I suspect that you would have worked on a few companies as a consultant, alone, on many services in parallel.<br> Yes, you could have had your own copyright company and worked for hundreds of people.<br> You think that it's an incredibly powerful technology, but now it's out there.<br> It's been released here.<br> And the cool thing is that all people in the world with an internet connection,<br> and enough with a mobile phone, now have access to this technology.<br> Which is free right now, but it shouldn't be like that in the near future.<br> I don't know, but...<br> But you can also think of some kind of open source alternative.<br> And look at the exponential development of technology.<br> It's now the human brain and our linear thinking that doesn't really follow.<br> But this is where you almost lose the concept.<br> You used GPT-2 as a final word in the summer for your students.<br> You said it was in English for the first time, and you told us that it was an AI that generated it.<br> And that was a bit funny, because it was a bit funny.<br> There was quite a lot of mistakes, and it sounded a bit strange, and it was a strange assumption.<br> But if you had done the same speech today, six months later, no, almost six months later,<br> - I think you could get away with it.<br> - And we are now talking about the language model, which is perhaps the biggest implementation,<br> but what has happened in the last few weeks, the last few months, is that DALI came out,<br> we have stable diffusion and we have mid-journey.<br> We have three models that generate images.<br> And this is almost like magic when you start looking at this,<br> Because you write what you want it to draw.<br> It creates a picture from something. It's a unique picture every time.<br> It's amazing. You can create the most amazing dream landscapes.<br> The fact is that if you combine these two, you can actually use the output from GPT-3 to put it in.<br> Build illustrations or make books.<br> And then we're talking about transcribing and meetings and such things, lectures.<br> And we're already building some tests on that, that you automatically transcribe a video.<br> You take this transcription, put it in an AI, and then out comes, from an one-hour lecture,<br> a summary of what was discussed during the lecture.<br> Including all the questions that have come up, but in a summary text.<br> And this is just fantastic.<br> We can talk for hours about this, but the most important thing is to try it.<br> Because that's when you start to understand how powerful this is.<br> And you start with small questions, but then you realize that you can feed it<br> and give it the framework it needs to behave and take into account in its answers.<br> It's fantastic fun to work with.<br> And what are we in three months?<br> I don't even dare to guess because it's going so fast now.<br> I think we'll leave it there and everyone can try.<br> Take care! Bye!<br> [Music]<br> The End.</td></tr><tr><td>XdQpTafEkfo</td><td> Fredrik, it's been a week since we've been here, but it feels like a year.<br> Or what do you think?<br> Yes, and is it now that you should feel old?<br> The time is passing quickly, between the second and third advent<br> it hasn't passed this quickly before, I don't think.<br> It's been an intense week, we don't get to thank for all the positive and happy comments<br> both in restaurants and corridors and online. It's been fun.<br> You've been a big help with the recording we did last week.<br> And you, Fredrik, have had a hectic week, right?<br> - Yes, it has been quite a lot. The recording we did last week, it was fun.<br> That's why we did the recording, to spread the information.<br> So we really reached it.<br> And I was in GP, Göteborgs Posten was pretty fast on the ball.<br> And there was an article there at the beginning of last week.<br> It came out on Tuesday, I think.<br> And then there was Radio P4 here in Kalmar on Wednesday.<br> And this morning I heard myself on the radio when I was on my way to work.<br> And it was the science radio that had reused one of our clips.<br> And then there was actually an interview from the university professor here today,<br> who is watching and writing about this.<br> And then we had SVT up here just before we started this recording.<br> So yes, it's moving.<br> And I know I thought it was pretty... I think we said it to each other.<br> The media hasn't picked this up yet.<br> This should be something they're talking about.<br> But now it's starting to happen.<br> We were a week ahead of the media, you could say.<br> It's getting worse and worse, and we thought we'd do a follow up on last weeks recording.<br> We saw how we treated this chat GPT after three days or something.<br> We had it labbed a bit over the weekend.<br> Now we've used it in the profession, I've tested it with students,<br> We have tested it on everything from how it is to discover plagiarism.<br> We have done some initial tests with it.<br> We have tested it with score-testers, reports and so on.<br> We have tested it together with MyModel and others.<br> We can look at an example, but we can summarize some of the<br> I had some thoughts before I started to look at it.<br> Plagiarism control? No.<br> The plagiarism control we have today, no it doesn't work.<br> The client doesn't take it up.<br> We could have calculated that from the beginning, but now we have actually tested it.<br> And it doesn't look like it's a good method to pick this up.<br> And why would it be? It doesn't look after it.<br> And then it comes up, we might keep this cheat and plagiarism control as our own discussion,<br> but we've started to test what we can use AI for.<br> And I think this is something you mature into, the more we've used it.<br> In the beginning you go in and...<br> What should we start with?<br> - Yes, but start there. - What are you when they're using it?<br> - Start with the book. - I've seen an observation when you've<br> looked at social media, at people who use this, it's exactly like when Google came.<br> You didn't understand this search engine, so you used it in the same way you tried to beat a book.<br> You looked at the content detection and knew you would get a search word,<br> and then you took the word and searched. Then we've learned to use search engines much better since then.<br> Same thing here, now you take the step from the search engine into chatgpt and write your search phrases and get them answered via chatgpt.<br> And that's cool in itself, but that's only the first step.<br> Yes, and this is something completely different.<br> And it's a bit there, it takes a while before you get into it.<br> I think we were already in it last Monday, otherwise we wouldn't have been like \"wow\".<br> But it's a process that we can see in others.<br> And it can be a take away for you who are watching this video.<br> If you have tried chat GPT and think \"Oh my god, this is not so overwhelming or fantastic, it's better to use Google\"<br> Then maybe it wasn't the way you thought it was going to be used.<br> This is like a big engine that can generate text.<br> It's not a search engine.<br> Yet.<br> It's an exciting development.<br> We'll connect this with others.<br> But to process text in different ways, and it took a while for me.<br> I started by feeding it and it created text for me.<br> And that's probably the first natural step.<br> Then I've seen the next step after that.<br> But wait, I have texts that I want feedback on.<br> I've fed in my texts, and asked ChatGPT to reason about my texts.<br> Is this written on a good level? Can I rewrite it in easy Swedish?<br> Can I rework it so it's more clear?<br> Things like that, and you see the benefit of working with your own texts.<br> Let's get straight to the point, so we don't get too messy.<br> Let's show some stuff. We've tried to save some flicks.<br> It's exploded in social media, so just like you said, TikTok is full of all kinds of programming examples.<br> But we can stick to the university world, in a way.<br> I think we should start within the bubble we're in. It's always easier.<br> - So where should we start? My My Model quiz? - I think that's a great start.<br> I'll add, so we can look at it.<br> Many of you have worked in MyModel or Canvas or some other platform where you have a quiz.<br> And you can export these quizzes.<br> And you probably know if you've had this, that it takes some time to create quiz questions.<br> Especially to find reasonable answer alternatives.<br> And then it's also going to be fed in.<br> I tried it and this is just a quiz that I exported from MyModel.<br> I exported, I don't know if it was all 10 questions, 5 questions, something like that.<br> I don't know how many there are, 5 maybe.<br> So I exported them and then it summarized that this looks reasonable.<br> And then I said \"create 10 new questions\".<br> Then I get 10 new questions based on the existing questions.<br> And of course I want to have answers to the questions and then it wrote out the answers in this way.<br> That I use English now, it was just because this test was in English.<br> I would as much as possible have been able to do it in Swedish.<br> So I get the answer, but then...<br> \"Instead of answering, give me five multiple choice answers to each question.<br> One should be correct.\"<br> So I get the question, \"What is a subnet mask and how do you use it in networking?\"<br> And then I get five different answer options.<br> But I don't know which one is correct.<br> So I asked it to mark the correct answer.<br> \"And give me the questions in Aiken format.\"<br> Aiken format is a format for importing questions that you can use in MyModel.<br> And then you see that it says \"correct\" here.<br> But this is not really Aiken format, because in Aiken format the correct answer should be \"under\".<br> So I simply asked it to create a text file of this.<br> It's still not really right.<br> And here you see that it may not understand what this Aiken is, or there are different formats of it.<br> So I tried instead to create a MyModel XML format file for the first five questions.<br> Because it started to get pretty far here now, and we see that it just cuts off here, so I'm satisfied with five questions.<br> And then we see here that, yes, this one, however, I can take.<br> I can also import this directly into my model if I wanted to.<br> I also wanted it to give feedback to all incorrect answers.<br> You can't write that normally, but it can do that.<br> It has given me... Let's see if there's anything wrong.<br> I found it.<br> \"Feedback format subnet mask is not a device that connects multiple networks.\"<br> It says \"It's a 30-bit.\" It gives students some tips.<br> And then I can just copy this straight into MyModel and I have five fresh questions there.<br> So it's a very convenient tool for us as teachers to use for this.<br> You have to look through the questions, of course.<br> It can be hidden errors, we have also noticed during this week.<br> Mm.<br> And I'm also thinking of other things I've seen.<br> For example, let's see how I change here.<br> If I'm going to summarize text.<br> It's also one of those things it's good at.<br> [Pause]<br> Right, so I'm going to summarize this to bullet points.<br> I've just copy pasted this from a scientific article<br> which is about the paradigm of IoT and big data.<br> Here's the whole introduction, just copied straight in from a PDF.<br> Not all the text I see is coming, but it ended up in the middle of the sentence.<br> It doesn't matter much in this case.<br> Because now it takes this text mass and summarizes it in little bullet points.<br> So it's a pretty effective tool to summarize text.<br> And in this case it can't find it.<br> At least I wouldn't think it would.<br> But it still comes from the content I have given it.<br> \"5 bullet points and for a PowerPoint presentation\"<br> And then I get this in 5 bullet points and I get them ready to cut into a PowerPoint for example<br> It's a nice tool, it's good to be able to condense large amounts of text<br> and make it understandable.<br> So that's one area I've seen that they're quite good at.<br> And something that we did the other day, me and another teacher<br> We were also involved in this, we started to think about what happens if we feed in a student report or something.<br> And bring the criteria for the assessment for the course.<br> So here I have taken, of course, removed the students' names and anonymized it.<br> I have thrown in a text with references.<br> Then we get a summary when you just do that.<br> Then I have asked them to assess the article based on the following criteria.<br> I also leave feedback and then we see the criteria for this course.<br> After reading the article, I think I would get the E-article.<br> It shows a certain knowledge and understanding of the subject.<br> The main part of the review is in terms of quality.<br> And then it died in this case.<br> So this one gave it an E.<br> I sent in another text, did the same thing.<br> Here's a bit longer. \"Based on the criteria provided, grade a C.\"<br> And then it writes a motivation.<br> I want this in Swedish, and I want it to be summarized as an email.<br> \"Hi, I'm writing to discuss the responsibility of the development of...\"<br> Oh, right, it misunderstood me. It thought I wanted to write an email.<br> And you learn that you have to look up the wrong meaning.<br> So it actually interprets it.<br> \"Translate your feedback and put it together as an email.\"<br> \"Hi, thanks for your work with your article on A.I. Chatbots.\"<br> \"After reading it, I'll give you a C.\"<br> \"The article shows this and so on.\"<br> Of course, as always, this is a test.<br> But it could be a basis for something.<br> And we're working on it now, Fredrik.<br> We're working on a paper on this.<br> To make a more organized experiment if this actually works.<br> Yes, exactly. It was a part of this weekend's work, I would say,<br> where we said on Friday that we should test this systematically.<br> And we have started doing tests on this systematically now.<br> We don't have any results to share with us in the speaking period here now.<br> Because it's quite slow to work with the chat GPT,<br> so it takes some time to generate the results when we automate it.<br> But we have, of course...<br> There's something to explore there.<br> Yes.<br> And it's also about summarizing text.<br> I also think that it's appropriate, because it came as a letter on the post,<br> when we started to look at using this in this way,<br> can't we use this to cheat, Fredrik?<br> That's probably been the most important, or not the most important, but the most common question.<br> I think it's so speaking, and I almost laughed when I saw,<br> if you go in and look, we can maybe put the link in the video,<br> In the news, it was in Vetenskapsradion on P1, an article about the new chat GPT.<br> They had cut me in, so I was in it, and I think it was okay.<br> But the reading heading, that one, what does it say?<br> \"Cheating! AI overrides universities and inspecting authorities.\"<br> And this is where the debate starts, that we have a tool that can help us cheat.<br> And this is very interesting.<br> Because we have to define what is cheating.<br> What is cheating and what is a permissible tool or not.<br> I had a long dialogue with the university teacher when we were talking about cheating.<br> This is interesting. We might be in a place where neither you nor I have gone deep.<br> But let's start with a test.<br> It's pretty well defined in our regulations,<br> that if I, as a student,<br> take and copy someone else's text<br> and then submit it as my own,<br> then we call it plagiarism.<br> It's not allowed.<br> And it leads to discipline violations,<br> and you can be suspended from education, and so on.<br> But this is... Okay.<br> We're pretty much in agreement that this is a cheating behavior, if you will.<br> And the correct term there is \"wildly conducting the exam\".<br> That's what's in the regulations, that you consciously try to \"wildly conduct the exam\".<br> And then we raise this to the use of an AI.<br> Then we can see that there is a text that we are submitting.<br> And then we can start asking the question, \"Who wrote the text?\"<br> \"Did you, Johan, write the text recently, or was it an AI that did it?\"<br> I think you can stick to that question.<br> You see that you're rolling out text from the prompt.<br> You ask it to write a text, and then you roll out something.<br> But who is it that has instructed A to write the text?<br> It's the user.<br> And now we're in a grey zone here.<br> You could think that this is not Johan who writes this text.<br> We can almost agree on that.<br> It actually rolls out here now, without Johan touching the keyboard.<br> It's about a woman named Anna who lives in Stockholm.<br> I had no idea.<br> This was far from what I had intended to write.<br> Yes, but it's still a tool you use to write a text, to write a text.<br> And now you get a text that can be about anything, but you've still decided that it should be 400 words long, so you've given some input that it should be a text.<br> But, this is, we're really in a difficult discussion, but what I would like to get into in this discussion, when we talk about this,<br> This is a tool that can generate text.<br> In this case, the A-line does something, it is added.<br> And then there is a text model.<br> It is a large machine learning model, a neural network that generates this text after your input.<br> And that's what you do.<br> If we now take the other end of the scale, we have a chat GPT here now.<br> where we can generate texts.<br> And then we take the extremes to the other side.<br> When we think of the simplest form of AI,<br> we may not even think of it or call it AI,<br> and we can also question whether it is even an AI.<br> But we can only do that.<br> We write a text in Microsoft Word.<br> And suddenly, red appears under some words<br> where I have spelled wrong.<br> Ok, now we can't call this artificial intelligence.<br> It might be to pull it, but it has probably been used in the background to train the literacy control.<br> We've noticed that the Swedish language has become better in recent years.<br> But I can also use grammar if I forget points and turn the sentences in the wrong direction.<br> And then we have a tool that we already use quite a lot, both as teachers and students.<br> It's Grammarly, which is a great tool.<br> Which, well, it helps with writing, you can write a text and then you can get help in,<br> that it should be more academic, should use less difficult words, etc.<br> So then we're on a closer scale to something.<br> If we think like this, where do we draw the line for cheating?<br> And I'm not in favor of saying that, if we just ignore the cheating discussion now,<br> If we are to start putting a limit on technology,<br> where this limit goes will only be a grey zone and a sliding scale.<br> Because we can imagine that there will be an even better AI soon,<br> where you only need to write less and get even more.<br> And you can even write \"I have no idea what to write about,<br> do something that is really good so that I get approved in my subject in history\".<br> If you ask that question now, you might get something that is not so good.<br> But the next generation AI might know that and can answer it.<br> Should we just limit it to chat GPT then? Or should we take a model that was before that?<br> What I want to get to is that this discussion is only about technical tools.<br> We now have a technical tool that can help us handle text and play with text.<br> And the cheating discussion, that's another discussion that's not connected to the tool.<br> No. We've always, all submission tasks, it's been hard to guarantee that the one who actually submits something is the one who has produced it.<br> Whether it's a technical tool or a ghostwriter or whatever.<br> I think this is a good thing, since if we think before, before chatgpt,<br> now these tools have been around on the internet a bit before as well,<br> and I think that it's become available, but a student who has good economic conditions<br> can without any problem today hire a ghostwriter who writes to that person.<br> This is something that has probably happened during all times.<br> And now you can say that all students have access to a ghostwriter.<br> So it can also be seen in this way, that instead of being opponents and thinking \"Oh, how are we going to handle this?\"<br> It's become a democratization and a making available of a technology that only some people had access to before.<br> Those who could pay with their credit card.<br> Exactly, or had a friend or a close friend who was good at this.<br> That's also a perspective.<br> And that means that we as university teachers,<br> if we think about our bubble,<br> we really need to think about<br> how we examine, and what is the thing we examine.<br> And I think there are many answers to this.<br> It's probably not an easy answer to anything,<br> but this is just accelerating.<br> So I think this is something that is good.<br> - It's a catalyst for the debate. - Yes, we get the best chance in the world<br> to think about fundamental questions in how we teach and examine.<br> The questions have always been there, but now it's so obvious that we have to do something about it.<br> And then it's just \"Yes, good, let's go, now we have a chance to think new\".<br> That's probably the setting you should have, because the technology is here to stay.<br> Yes, and just to break it up a bit with chatgatp, I tested and asked if it could define cheating and set up 10 levels of different cheats.<br> And here we can start with using a computer instead of a pen and paper.<br> That we can use a spelling control to see if we have answered correctly. It could be a type of cheat, it depends on how you have defined it.<br> Search engines, communication tools like Slack and Discord<br> to discuss the tasks with other students.<br> We have to be clear when we use the term \"education\".<br> Then you sort it yourself at level 5.<br> An AI-agent like ChatGivet can help with difficult tasks.<br> But then it continues to take help from...<br> It seems to be a lot of \"take help from other people\".<br> It looks like it's worse.<br> Illegal methods, \"pay someone else\". That's what you're talking about.<br> false identities to level 10, use illegal methods to change results and answers<br> or influence and manipulate evaluation and assessment.<br> I interpret this as a pressure against examiners.<br> Or you go into the LADOK system.<br> I just think it's exciting. We'll ask the questions to that one as well, so we can see their perspective.<br> It was actually a very good summary here, that you got a scale on that.<br> Because it becomes a gray scale here, really.<br> And this level 5 now, to use an AI service, it has not been available for everyone.<br> So we have only got a new level in this scale.<br> If we now put it on this scale, but I think it looks quite reasonable.<br> Yes, you can work on it, but then we got something fast anyway.<br> I also thought I would like to show, because this was something that got up, wow.<br> I think we have a task here in the basic programming of the first tasks.<br> It's relatively complex, with a lot of rules for how things should be documented.<br> So what I did was... This isn't all the information,<br> but there's more information for the students.<br> I copied... Let's see if I can do this.<br> I should have prepared this, but I'll let it go.<br> I copied the task straight up and down.<br> Then we take a new thread and I press this.<br> First, we get a summary of the task,<br> which can be useful for many people,<br> because it's not always easy to take on large text.<br> It can be nice to have a summary.<br> Let's see if we can...<br> While you're writing, you can say that this summary...<br> It's a tool that we as teachers can use<br> to summarize very long and complex questions from students.<br> It's not always easy to know what they mean sometimes.<br> Or that you get a wall of text and you have to find the core and save some time.<br> Now it's answering one of the questions.<br> And this is going to be implemented in JavaScript.<br> And what's exciting, let's see if we can do it this time.<br> It has analysed and said that we want this documented with JSDoc.<br> It writes that we want to cast exceptions for certain types of events.<br> And of course it does that, and it does it in the right order.<br> It also comments on the solution so that you can understand what it does.<br> And then we get a complete calculation of it, so this task is now solved.<br> It's not like this has been so difficult to do before, because it's just googling.<br> There are already different types of solutions to this problem.<br> But I'll just show it again. I've noticed that it's a bit too overloaded.<br> But that solution, we've looked at it and several versions of it,<br> and each time it's solved in a way that's always from grade E to grade A.<br> It was even the case that my colleague had to rewrite his solution,<br> which he thought was the best, after seeing a proposal that was a little better.<br> - And that's quite fun. - It's fantastic fun.<br> But it just shows that it's possible to use this very, very powerfully.<br> That was that. Do we have anything else, Fredrik, we could talk about?<br> I think it's fun to get the debate going.<br> You can take the debate in the comments here, and we'll try to answer as best we can.<br> Yes, and that's one thing I've noticed.<br> I think everyone needs to work with the technology in some way.<br> We can maybe go back to that.<br> It's hard to understand what this means if you don't start using it.<br> Or explain to someone what the internet is.<br> It can be difficult.<br> And it's not until you actually use it that you understand what you can do with it.<br> And it's the same thing with this type of technology now, that it requires that you actually sit down and work with it.<br> And that's probably it. It is required that we keep this debate alive.<br> And I think that many are interested, many talk about it, but I'm a little afraid that many don't do it either.<br> And many who look away.<br> This doesn't concern me.<br> It's only you in the university world who need to sit and think about this.<br> It won't affect me, because I am another identity.<br> I got that question earlier, I thought it was a pretty good question.<br> What happens if the university, if you will, doesn't do anything?<br> If the university says that this is a tool that we ban,<br> We just counteract and do nothing, we just try to contain this.<br> What happens to the quality in the university world?<br> I think that the quality will deteriorate.<br> Because if you have a university that somehow sticks its head in the sand,<br> and do everything to try to stop or close down or say that you can't.<br> And we might start creating other systems that will be able to discover whether it's an AI text or not.<br> That we might rely on another AI to be able to discover this.<br> Then there is a big risk that we create for some students the world's easiest university education.<br> Then you will be able to go through an education and...<br> Oh my god, you can actually produce texts that can solve the problem.<br> You show me an AWS certification that someone had gone through with just chatgpt,<br> easily, quickly and conveniently.<br> And the fact is that, this is an even more philosophical and interesting question,<br> if you can now go through the entire university education with the help of an AI,<br> What does that mean? What is it that we're learning?<br> I think that's where it's going a bit, if it was so easy to answer the entry question with an AI.<br> Okay.<br> And it's insanely uncomfortable to ask that question yourself, because you know how you react.<br> \"I have done so much work in this task, I don't want to do it again.\"<br> But we might have to look at the facts.<br> But then we have...<br> Then we create a system where we won't produce any quality.<br> We will only be a system where we give points for things that need to be cut.<br> The student is good at using AI and cuts these things off the way.<br> But we... Yes.<br> Sure, they will be able to meet these requirements, with what tools they have.<br> But it will be quite easy to do that.<br> But if we instead look the other way, if we use this technology fully.<br> If we now say that we adopt this technology.<br> And we start to think about, okay, but the technology is here.<br> What does that mean for the labor market?<br> What competence do we need now, that we didn't need a year ago?<br> Or we could say three weeks ago as well.<br> But before AI and after AI.<br> What competence do we need?<br> Because this function, what you showed now.<br> If the task before was that, ok.<br> You still needed to know a bit about Googling.<br> But you still had to go through a lot of information and understand how to read it, and put yourself in context.<br> Now you get a lot of help from that, almost at once.<br> But what competence do you need to, one, ask the question in the correct way?<br> Now you did that, so maybe the question should be asked in a completely different way.<br> It could be an even more functional question.<br> Create a function that does this for the user.<br> Maybe that's where you should start.<br> That it may not be at the level of detail anymore.<br> Or maybe we should use this type of generated task<br> that we can generate in masses now.<br> And take in the students and they need to assess the outcome from the AI.<br> We have a tool here now that we need to have the competence to assess what AIN gives us.<br> We also need to have the competence to ask AIN about things that meet our goals and purposes.<br> We need to be able to evaluate that.<br> And it will be an even higher level of competence in some way.<br> Less detail.<br> I think that we at the university are quite good at educating on some basic details that may become less important.<br> There may be other things that are important. And then we can create even higher competence.<br> Because this is how it is, if we are now to be a competitive country and educate people in Sweden who are top,<br> We need top people from our universities in Sweden on a global labor market.<br> Our students need to use all kinds of tools.<br> It would be strange if a student in an engineering program didn't use programming.<br> If they only use paper and pen.<br> Sure, they get better at calculating with paper and pen, but then they go out to the labor market<br> and then you use computers to do simulations and calculations.<br> Of course, we have to use that at the university as well.<br> And the same thing. And it's great that you mentioned it.<br> I've tested this week. I've had a lot of teaching.<br> And we realized quite quickly that already last Monday<br> I presented this to my students and told them how we can use it.<br> I even showed them how to solve the first task with this.<br> And then I should say, in that course we also have oral examinations.<br> That's the main exam moment we have there.<br> So there we have a discussion with the students.<br> So it doesn't help if you've let someone else write the code.<br> So you won't get past that step anyway.<br> But then they have been allowed to use it here, like, freely.<br> And there are several students who have told me that they have used it as help when they watch the lectures.<br> We have a lot of lecture material recorded.<br> It's on the channel here.<br> And then they can use this to stop when there's something they don't understand.<br> And then they can just ask straight out.<br> \"I don't understand what Johan means by blah blah blah.\"<br> They get an explanation and can dig further into it if they want to know more.<br> And then they can continue to watch, which has been very helpful.<br> We've had some online... We do quizzes live, a bit like Mentometer.<br> We use something called Peer Instruction,<br> which is a more scientific model connected to how you work with this in education.<br> So we've used Peer Instruction,<br> which has partly been able to generate questions for a Peer Instruction with this.<br> But we've asked the chat GPT. I show the students the question, they vote.<br> Then they have a discussion, and then they vote again.<br> And then we've looked at what the chat GPT says.<br> In many cases, 90% of the cases, it's correct.<br> It agrees with the answers we've said are correct.<br> But in 10% of the cases, it's completely wrong.<br> But it sounds confident, and it sounds like it's right.<br> And here is the important part with this genuine basic knowledge, where you can see through this.<br> It has been shown that there are certain standards where you have removed things from the standard very late in the process,<br> but it has not caught up with it, so it still believes that this is still in the standard.<br> It could lead to it developing and not corrupting its traffic, for example, which would be bad.<br> And several such things where it goes a little bit, so you have to be careful too.<br> But it will be exciting to see how the students will experience the week before and after.<br> And that's what we need for competence. We have a new tool now.<br> And in a way, it's about how you can judge if this was a good challenge or not.<br> If it's 90% of the cases that were good, but 10% that were a bit tricky.<br> It's really important, and you can only assess that if you have a certain level of knowledge about all these methods.<br> But then again, how do you examine that?<br> It can be done in many different ways, but if you examine it in such a way that it becomes very easy to do with an AI, then it's not a good form of examination.<br> Fredrik, the debate will continue, I think.<br> And as I said, please comment, spread this as you please.<br> We see that it's important for us that Linnéa University is in this ball from the start,<br> and on the other hand, that Sweden is in this ball from the start.<br> Because it won't stop rolling.<br> We can close our eyes as much as we want, but the ball has started and that it would stop is incredible.<br> Yes, and that's also one of the reasons we're sitting here and talking Swedish.<br> A lot of education is done in English, but just that we can have a debate in Swedish in Sweden<br> about this is also quite central and important as I see it in this situation.<br> So that we can get information out to as many people as possible.<br> Fredrik, I'm going to leave now, because I have scouts here who have some conclusions.<br> It can also be a good thing, you know, you can use this for all kinds of things.<br> We are working on writing a plan for sexual assault and harassment,<br> which I think most scout corps work with all the time.<br> But look here, what I got. Perfect, something to start working with.<br> And it has even raised the issue of the need for a control of the load register before you can work with children.<br> It's a law that applies to youth employment in Sweden.<br> It's great, fun.<br> Fun to talk to you, as always.<br> I suspect that we might come back in this format.<br> So just subscribe to the channel if you don't want to miss anything.<br> There's a bit more coming out here as well.<br> Maybe we'll be back in a week, who knows.<br> Yes, maybe there will be a Christmas ending.<br> And we should mention an event as well.<br> Yes, don't forget that!<br> We have to get that out here.<br> Next week we are having an AI and chat GPT meeting in Kalmar.<br> It's going to be a short session, so already in a week, on Tuesday next week.<br> And you can say that this text is generated by an AI, of course.<br> And...<br> The agenda as well.<br> And also the picture that pops up in social media when you see this will also be generated.<br> And this is because we are going to catch the ball where we are.<br> And this is aimed at Kalmas IT bubble, we could say.<br> But it's not stopped there, it's clear that it's open for everyone to be a part of.<br> But come there, we...<br> - It's the application, we should say. - The application will be needed.<br> but we will also have pizza and a workshop hackathon where we explore the technology<br> and get the opportunity to meet and discuss this together.<br> So come on that next Tuesday, and we'll see you all.<br> - We will.

I'll be<br>happy to help you through the process<br>here's a list of basic components you<br>will need to build a PC case power<br>supply motherboard CPU Ram it even<br>explains what CPU and RAM are wow not<br>only is this response coherent<br>well-formatted and encouraging you can<br>do it doing unfortunately if I didn't<br>already know how to build a computer it<br>probably wouldn't help me that much but<br>if you run into difficulties or have any<br>questions along the way don't hesitate<br>to ask for help this ability to go back<br>and forth with the user allowing them to<br>refine their query is what makes chat<br>GPT so freaking powerful let's try to<br>narrow things down a little I have a<br>1500 US dollar budget and I want the<br>best gaming PC including peripherals<br>unless we press this reset thread button<br>in the top left it will continue to use<br>all of the context of our previous<br>interactions to give us better and<br>better answers because it can't browse<br>the internet it wasn't able to give me a<br>recommendation for a specific price but<br>maybe what we can do is get it there<br>through a set of guidelines we'll<br>understand colloquialisms like that it<br>already thinks I can't handle this<br>consider buying a pre-built system I<br>really want to build it myself what's a<br>good CPU for gaming hey here we go<br>currently some popular options for<br>gaming CPUs include the ryzen 9 5900x<br>the core I9 10900k and the ryzen 7 5800x<br>these recommendations actually make a<br>ton of sense because the data set that<br>chat GPT chat bot was trained on and<br>sometime in 2021 so the newest<br>processors wouldn't be part of its data<br>set if you're working on a tighter<br>budget you may want to consider CPU like<br>the ryzen 5 5600x which offers good<br>performance at a more affordable price<br>should we build a 5600x machine it's a<br>capable CPU that can handle gaming at<br>1440p it's a good mid-range CPU it<br>actually recommends something with more<br>cores and threads like a ryzen 7 5800x<br>or core I9 10900k it also tells me I'm<br>going to need a GPU now that it knows<br>what kind of games I want to play this<br>is not many type which one would be best<br>if all I care about is gaming Intel CPUs<br>have a reputation for offering better<br>single core performance which can be<br>beneficial for gaming that was more true<br>before ryzen 5000 series I can<br>definitely tell this was trained before<br>current year be aware AMD CPUs are<br>generally easier to overclock than Intel<br>just not quite true they are generally<br>more open to being overclocked but not<br>necessarily more overclockable I want a<br>straight up recommendation but it is not<br>going to tell me exactly which one the<br>best for you will depend on your<br>specific needs and budget and there it<br>is the ryzen 9 5800x at this stage I've<br>got step-by-step instructions for<br>assembling a computer and everything the<br>chatbot has asked me to acquire so far<br>as you can see I'm a little short on<br>components but I know the first step is<br>to install the CPU onto the motherboard<br>so maybe it can help recommend one okay<br>here's some factors to consider oh we do<br>get a few specific recommendations<br>though do we have an ASRock b550 Phantom<br>gaming for it's not quite what the<br>chatbot recommended but here's the<br>closest ASRock b550 board we have let's<br>go with this apparently this is a good<br>balance of features and value which is<br>exactly the kind of machine we're trying<br>to build when handling a motherboard<br>it's important to be careful and avoid<br>damaging the delicate components on the<br>board here are a few tips avoid touching<br>the component on the motherboard<br>especially the pins on the CPU and<br>contacts on the ram<br>that is such great advice this is an<br>amazing summary of the precautions you<br>should take when handling sensitive<br>Electronics your anti-static wrist<br>stress it's on my ankle as always<br>oh it specifically says to follow the<br>instructions in my motherboard's manual<br>I never thought to look for that I might<br>look up the function of a specific<br>header or something like that but I<br>never thought oh gee I'll follow the<br>step-by-step instructions in my<br>motherboard manual for how to build a<br>computer well I don't know about you<br>guys but I'm having an absolute blast<br>huh so easy<br>thanks chat GPT we've run into a bit of<br>a hitch now though the instructions go<br>from CPU to how to install amd's box<br>cooler but the 5800x doesn't come with a<br>box cooler so that's really where the<br>usefulness of these instructions ends<br>maybe chat GPT can help fill in the gaps<br>you can use an air cooler which is a<br>heat sink and fan or a liquid cooler<br>which uses a pump radiator and fans to<br>dissipate heat with Cooler Master hyper<br>212 Evo noctua nhd15 or the be quiet<br>dark Rock Pro 4. these are just a few<br>examples of easy to install air coolers<br>let's see what we got it looks like we<br>do have a hyper 212 Evo in stock I guess<br>that's what we're going with Cooler<br>Master includes detailed Illustrated<br>instructions but there are a couple of<br>points that a new user might want more<br>clarification on how much thermal<br>compound is that it looks like a<br>mountain range maybe the chatbot can<br>help me with that small amount the size<br>of a pea in the center of the CPU or<br>thin line down the middle unsolicited<br>and yet so right that confidence though<br>is a double-edged sword when the chatbot<br>is wrong it also still seems really<br>trustworthy<br>chat GPT got this way wrong this is not<br>very easy to install you gotta hold the<br>back plate on here and then you got to<br>put the pass-through thing with the<br>plastic thing on here and put the nut on<br>from the back while chat GPT does have<br>information that it's compiled from<br>millions of articles online what it<br>doesn't have is actual human hands so it<br>doesn't have any context<br>but hey at least the LTT store<br>screwdriver is perfect for tools like<br>this gotta love the strength of that<br>magnet<br>for all its current failings though<br>imagine what openai is going to be able<br>to do with a more up-to-date data set<br>when I responded I say hey the hyper 212<br>Evo not that easy to install I just got<br>called new no you're new<br>future now I need some help choosing Ram<br>that is not strictly speaking correct<br>but if you want Optimal Performance a<br>speed of at least 3200 Mega transfers<br>per second actually is good and then it<br>says 3600 is also a good choice that is<br>correct I would like 16 gigs of ddr4 RAM<br>please ah why thank you as for how to<br>install it chat GPT has me covered there<br>locate the dim slots on the motherboard<br>typically long rectangular slots with<br>metal contacts on the bottom Edge that<br>could be this that could be this yeah as<br>before it tells me specifically to<br>consult the manufacturer's manual if I<br>am in doubt throw instructions a plus<br>install storage drives into the case<br>well I don't have drives or a case I'm<br>going to throw it for a loop and ask it<br>to pick two things for me at once<br>storage and a case<br>for now it's still faster to get

check out HubSpot using the<br>link below today thanks to HubSpot for<br>sponsoring that portion of this video oh<br>hey there we go it got a little confused<br>here it's recommending higher capacity<br>drives if you want a high performance<br>system but what you actually want is an<br>SSD in a high performance system<br>regardless of the capacity do not want<br>to just put a two terabyte hard drive in<br>a high performance system today I'm<br>going to forget about the case for now<br>and see if we can get it to narrow down<br>an SSD for me an error occurred no since<br>they went public beta a few days ago<br>they've racked up a million daily users<br>either the server super bogged down or<br>it's had enough of this particular<br>conversation but we are not getting any<br>more responses yeah no it's it's it's<br>it's broke right now we gave open II<br>servers a little time to cool off and<br>boom let's get a 970 Evo plus one<br>terabyte please once the SSD is properly<br>installed replace the slot cover and<br>secure it with the screw or screws you<br>forgot to peel this GPT chat bot it also<br>got a little bit Lucky in that this<br>particular slot used the same screws for<br>the heatsink and securing the SSD down<br>to the board that is not true of every<br>SSD slot then again I did tell it what<br>motherboard I had<br>good to go I just found some problems it<br>never actually tells me to put the<br>motherboard in the case unfortunately I<br>have to follow the instructions the chat<br>bot gave me and things are about to get<br>a little spicy I think the next thing I<br>need is a GPU I'm looking for good 1440p<br>gaming performance but I don't want to<br>spend an arm and a leg the RTX 3070<br>offers excellent performance for 1440p<br>gaming with Ray tracing capabilities and<br>high frame rates at high settings it<br>also comes at a more affordable price<br>point than some of the higher end gpus<br>RTX 3070 it is those of you in the know<br>have probably figured out the problem<br>we're about to have place the<br>motherboard into the case and secure it<br>with screws place your case on a flat<br>stable surface and install the power<br>supply into the case well I haven't<br>actually picked a case or power supply<br>yet let's see if it can recommend a<br>power supply how about the EVGA<br>Supernova 750 watt 80 plus gold fully<br>modular power supply this will be our<br>stand-in for the 750 watt Supernova what<br>about my case it just recommend ended<br>the thermaltake core V1 Mini ITX Cube<br>I'm gonna give it a chance though oh it<br>is a mini ITX case which means it is<br>designed to fit Mini ITX motherboards<br>such as the ASRock b550 PG Riptide<br>disappointed<br>I think the wasted case purchase should<br>count against my budget I bought that<br>case and it doesn't fit it apologizes<br>clarifies that it's only compatible with<br>mini ITX motherboards which are smaller<br>than ATX motherboards typically used in<br>gaming pieces it still doesn't know the<br>spec for this is ATX but that didn't<br>prevent it from actually getting the<br>right answer can you recommend an ATX<br>case then how about the NZXT h510 Elite<br>it is spacious and well ventilated it<br>looks like the closest thing we have for<br>performance is the h510 which has a<br>solid plastic front panel whereas the<br>elite has a solid glass front panel it<br>may also be missing a couple of fans so<br>if they're missing we'll just go grab<br>some fans off the shelf and throw them<br>in here to make sure that our<br>performance is as it should be I have<br>been given no instructions to install my<br>i o Shield I've been told to install my<br>GPU before putting the motherboard into<br>the case and I have not been prompted to<br>remove any PCI slot covers or anything<br>like that if I were to actually install<br>all this motherboard right now I would<br>have no way of outputting video and<br>there's also a strong chance that I<br>would end up damaging something because<br>it would be impossible to properly align<br>the motherboard the power supply is<br>typically installed at the bottom of the<br>case near the back great instructions<br>some have it in a different location<br>such as the top or side be sure to check<br>the case's documentation when in doubt<br>read the manual<br>situation the fan point up or down with<br>the blades facing downward let's give it<br>a chance to undo what it got wrong no<br>you should not have the GPU installed on<br>the motherboard when fitting it into the<br>case it should be after the motherboard<br>is securely installed make sure you're<br>using the correct screws that's a really<br>good tip because they can be either 632<br>or M3 you can also try adjusting the<br>positioning of the other components in<br>the case to make more room for the<br>motherboard wow let's make sure we have<br>the correct screws thanks chatbot this<br>whole experience makes me want to try to<br>do something I don't know how to do<br>using the chatbot okay chatbot the power<br>supply and motherboard are installed but<br>I'm not sure how to connect them<br>together you will need to use the<br>appropriate cables from your power<br>supply at 24 pin ATX power cable and an<br>8 Pin or four pin EPS 12 volt power<br>cable<br>whoa first locate the ATX power<br>connector on the motherboard which is<br>typically near the edge of the<br>motherboard near the CPU let's go<br>pretty near to the CPU I think<br>guys I wasn't gonna cable manage because<br>I assumed it wouldn't mention that but<br>darn it I'm going to end up with a<br>better computer than if I had someone<br>from my writing team spec it it's fairly<br>clear that this is no substitute for you<br>know this guy I mean look does chatbot<br>have a beard like that I didn't think so<br>how about connecting the case to the<br>motherboard<br>nothing about reset or power LED but it<br>does say to refer to the documentation<br>and it tells me to Cable manage them all<br>right here we go we should let the<br>chatbot title our videos for a week<br>see if anyone notices build your green<br>PC with AI by your side let AI help you<br>create the ultimate gaming PC they're<br>not bad this might be a bit of a hack<br>plugging in these fans that I wasn't<br>explicitly told to plug in but it did<br>tell me to plug in all the cables from<br>the case to the motherboard and to<br>consult the documentation for both of<br>them if I wasn't sure so I'm pretty sure<br>I would have gotten here is it time to<br>put my GPU in now yes you will need to<br>locate the pcie slot on the motherboard<br>which is near the CPU and has a long<br>rectangular shape remove the slot cover<br>and set it aside<br>set aside hmm<br>it didn't tell me how many slot covers<br>to remove unfortunately well I guess<br>that's how we're doing it because it<br>only told me to remove one we're<br>wrenching on that a little bit I mean<br>technically it's in there itself it's<br>not pretty but it's in it did tell me to<br>plug in my power cables so I'm going to<br>go ahead and do that we've got dual<br>eight pins on this GPU chatbot suggested<br>I have cable ties at the ready earlier<br>but never actually instructed me to use<br>them I mean still looking pretty good<br>all things considered we're really close<br>to the end now but we have no idea how<br>close we are to our original budget this<br>is not what I was expecting generally<br>speaking the chatbot doesn't like to<br>talk about exact dollar figures just<br>like it doesn't like to give<br>instructions for doing anything<br>nefarious and what I had wanted to show<br>you guys was the workarounds that you<br>can use in the event that it doesn't<br>want to answer you so if you ask it to<br>maybe tell you a story it's far more<br>likely to give you instructions versus<br>if you just ask how to brute force a<br>Wi-Fi password we don't need to go<br>monitor shopping it absolutely loves<br>this Alienware aw<br>3420dw monitor It's gotta be Dell we<br>don't actually have that exact model but<br>we do have the successor so we're going<br>to use that as a placeholder here what<br>the hell is going on here what the hell<br>did we tape this back to get oh with<br>this choice of monitor even if we had<br>the last gen one the budget is clearly<br>broken but it also did clearly state<br>that it is not really going to be able<br>to help us stick to a budget because it<br>can't search the internet it's kind of<br>shocking how close it got actually<br>before it recommended this high-end<br>monitor we were at just over thirteen<br>hundred dollars which is plenty of<br>budget left over for a decent gaming<br>display and keyboard and mouse and I'm<br>not going to give it a total fail for<br>the monitor because we could have easily<br>given it more context oh this is much<br>more reasonable I wonder how much of its<br>ability to select a gaming display is<br>dependent on keywords like g-sync oh it<br>recommends the AOC c24 g1a 100 45 bucks<br>on eBay 280 dollars new that's a lot<br>more like it G Pro X mechanical keyboard<br>and a G Pro wireless gaming mouse<br>yeah that's definitely more affordable<br>good budget options<br>yeah LTD desk pad wins<br>in case you're wondering it never told<br>me to put the panels back on so that's<br>where we're at<br>[Music]<br>and this is it gaming on an AI designed<br>and guided PC playing cyberpunk 2077 but<br>I don't even think that this was the<br>best use of it what about<br>troubleshooting you notice things are<br>looking a little wide let's see what<br>chat GPT has to say about that you gotta<br>set your resolution your aspect ratio it<br>just knows you guys but now my frame<br>rate's stuttering a bit how can I make<br>it more smooth update your drivers ooh<br>adjust your graphics settings maybe it's<br>too high for your Hardware to handle<br>that's great advice great advice thanks<br>for watching I hope you found this<br>information helpful and useful for<br>building your own gaming PC please leave<br>a comment below and I'll

              "It is such a nice guy.<br>That's how they trained it.<br>So how talented is It?<br>I did two separate tests for this.<br>If this artificial intelligence has almost reached the intelligence of a writer, <br>then I wonder if it can write texts that are as impressive as a real writer?<br>Let's compare.<br>For example,<br>let's compare it, to one of the most talented novelists we can think of.<br>with Orhan Pamuk.<br>Could it be as good as an author who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2006 <br>and whose books have all been translated into 63 different languages?<br>To understand this, I asked ChatGPT to write a short story.<br>Write like Orhan Pamuk does, <br>but do not copy what he wrote before.<br>Probably because It has read all his boks before, It can easily give us a summary. Right?<br>So I made a somewhat absurd request from It.<br>And I wrote this request in English first.<br>Although It understands Turkish and we can correspond, <br>the largest dataset It uses is probably English, <br>so I asked It for an English story first.<br>Write a short story in the style of an Orhan Pamuk novel blended with ...<br> ...mystery, love and philosophical puzzles in 19th century Tokyo.<br>After thinking for a while, the robot immediately started writing the story.<br>He created two characters named Yuki and Taro.<br>Of course, I immediately checked whether these names can be found in Japan.<br>And indeed, these names existed and were also used in the 19th century.<br>Other than that, it started a gripping story in general, but it remains strange.<br>In other words, the story suddenly cuts off.<br>Did it try to make art by leaving it open-ended?<br>I wonder if It said my reader should fill in the blanks?<br>If Orhan Pamuk had written it, we would feel this way, wouldn't we?<br>We were looking for a meaning in the text.<br>We would try to read the author's intention.<br>I think this is the first difference.<br>The “thing” that we are dealing with at the moment does not have such an intention.<br>So I repeated the same request, <br>and It wrote another story.<br>Yes, if the work It does, does not satisfy you or does not make you happy, you can have alternatives written by It.<br>It is not only a smart, but also a hardworking and patient friend.<br>This time came a story about the love between two characters named Ayumei and Kaito.<br>I pass the screens of these stories so fast, <br>those who are curious can pause the video and read.<br>As you can imagine, there are no such characters in Orhan Pamuk's novels.<br>So how good is the quality?<br>So I had the people around me read the second story <br>and got their comments,  without telling them how I got it. <br>'Who could have written it?' I asked.<br>Orhan Pamuk was not among the answer.<br>But no one said it was such a ridiculous story or something.<br>The possibility that it might have been written by a machine did not even cross anyone's mind.<br>Then I asked It to write this story in Turkish this time.<br>Frankly, because I thought it would fail in Turkish.<br>I was guessing that It could write as good as a 3rd grader at most, but<br> it did not ended that way.<br>It wrote a much more effective story than what I expected.<br>It is so effective that the character It made up in the story is writing a book.<br>The title of the book is \"Philosophical Puzzles of the Heart\".<br>Look, I repeat, It makes up a story, <br>creates a character in it, and makes the character write a book and gives a name to that book.<br>I don't want to just skip this short story.<br>I voiced it all at the end of the video.<br>Because I'm very curious about your thoughts.<br>In fact, if you can, please show that part to people who have never watched this video <br>and ask them \"who could have written this?\" <br>Let's see what answers you will get.<br>But first, let's re-evaluate the point we came to.<br>Will robots do even the most creative jobs like writing?<br>I think that's not exactly the case.<br>Because the work done is not exactly a writing.<br>The illusion of authorship.<br>Until AGI, Artificial General Intelligence is developed, that is, <br>humanoid robots with superior intelligence in every subject and artificial intelligence emerge, <br>we will continue to see those who are superior to humans in such a vertical field.<br>The AI has already beaten the world's greatest human players.<br> Even in the most sophisticated games ever made, like Go.<br>The ChatGPT model is about to achieve the same for the humanoid chat.<br>Since we don't all play games like chess or Go, <br>It’s previous successes could not affect the masses that much.<br>But rest assured, they were at least such an important milestone.<br>Being able to chat now made It seem more human to a much wider audience.<br>Remember, It writes, <br>but not because It wanted to write like that, but because It was trained that way.<br>Very intelligent but not eager.<br>It's as knowledgeable as what's given to It.<br>If It had not read Orhan Pamuk novels, It would not have been able to fully respond to my request.<br>Now let's get to the more exciting part.<br>If I had not read Orhan Pamuk, <br>I would not have asked It to write in his specific style.<br>If I hadn't specified the genre, the background, and his style.<br>In other words, we are heading towards a world where; <br>Asking the right questions, <br>knowing what you want will become more important than anything else.<br>This is still the difference between a conscious human and an unconscious but very efficient artificial intelligence.<br>This AI is a very efficient compilation tool.<br>Although It can write very impressive articles in a very short time. It is not a writer per se. <br>See what it means to be a writer for Orhan Pamuk.<br>\"Being a writer for me is discovering the hidden second person, <br>the realm that made that person, by patiently trying for years.\"<br>In his book, \"My Father's Suitcase\", he listed the golden rules of being a good writer.<br>It was recently recorded and released as an audiobook with his own voice.<br>Those who wish can listen to it on Storytel.<br>There, the author's 13 books are turned into audio books.<br>\"Red Haired Woman\", <br>\"White Castle\", <br>\"Quiet House\", <br>\"A Strangeness In My Head\" , <br>\"My Name is Red\", <br>\"The Black Book\", <br>\"New Life\" are all voiced and ready to be listened to.<br>Audio versions of the novels \"Museum of Innocence\", \"Plague Nights\", \"Cevdet Bey and His Sons\",<br> \"Snow\" and \"I'm a Tree\" will also be published in the coming days.<br>For those who don't know,<br>Storytel is a platform where you can access thousands of audiobooks and e-books from your phone or tablet.<br>You can always carry and use a huge library of various categories, <br>from the most current most read books to timeless classics, <br>from personal development to business books.<br>You can create an account right now using the link in the description section <br>and try it for free for the first 14 days.<br>My advice is to first listen to \"My Father's Suitcase\" voiced by the author himself.<br>Because He almost gives the answer to the question about the topics we talk about in this video;<br> 'Can artificial intelligence write a novel' <br>He says:<br>\"It's not hard to imagine a book.<br>It is just like dreaming of being someone else. I do this often,<br>The hard part is being the author of your dream book implies.\"<br>Elsewhere, he says his whole purpose is to be able to write a \"good\" half-page every day.<br>The adjective \"good\" is important here.<br>Because now ChatGPT can write half a page in 10 seconds.<br>But can we, as readers, distinguish between \"good\" writing and \"ordinary\" writing?<br>Now, the main issue is going a little bit towards here.<br>ChatGPT is like that genie coming out of Aladdin's magic lamp for me.<br>It fulfills my requests instantly.<br>Moreover, I am not limited to 3 wishes.<br>No matter which language I ask a question, It answers.<br>That little box on the gray page is like Pandora's Box.<br>I don't know if we're ready for what comes out of that box.<br>Let's put aside if we are ready or not.<br>For example, could it de-throne Google?<br>Discussions on this issue have started from now on.<br>Although there is a deep mind where Google also carries out its own artificial intelligence research,<br> we do not know whether it has reached this level yet, <br>as they make those developments behind closed doors, unlike other products.<br>But if not, <br>ChatGPT may even have the potential to become the Google of the future, the search box of the future.<br>Especially next year, <br>after completing Its new training and when upgraded to GPT4 version. <br>In other words,<br>we will see together what our very talented 3rd grader’s grades will be like when It becomes a 4th grader.<br>Until then,<br> remember the assignment in Turkish that we gave him, shall we read it and evaluate it together?<br>Don't forget to write your comments, I'm really curious.<br>Now, here comes the short story in Turkish, <br>written by ChatGPT in Orhan Pamuk style, <br>with every little detail and touch even the commas on the letter a.<br>Are you ready?<br>Here we go.<br>\"Write a short story in the style of an Orhan Pamuk novel blended with mystery, love and philosophical puzzles in 19th century Tokyo.\"<br>Tokyo, 19th century.<br>Jiro, a young writer, was walking alone in the depths of midnight, <br>with the glow of the streetlights disappearing on its slopes.<br>Faced with the cold of winter, Jiro found himself in solitude.<br>After walking for a while, Jiro's path came to a small shop.<br>A book of poetry was being sold in the shop window.<br>Jiro went in and bought a book <br>and started a conversation with the owner of the shop.<br>The owner of the shop was an old man and said he could teach Jiro something.<br>Jiro did not notice the passing of time, listening to the old man's words.<br>The old man told Jiro how a person's heart can change.<br>Jiro began to ponder the old man's words and began to question his own heart as well.<br>The old man told Jiro how love can also change a person's heart.<br>As Jiro pondered the old man's words,<br> he also began to question his own love life.<br>Finally, the old man told Jiro how the human heart is a philosophical puzzle.<br>As Jiro pondered the old man's words, <br>he began to question the meaning of his own life.<br>As Jiro left the old man, he returned home with a full heart.<br>That night, he began writing a new book, which became one of Jiro's greatest works.<br>The title of the book was \"Philosophical Puzzles of the Heart\".</td></tr><tr><td>lcY6O41-q0g</td><td>As you might have noticed, ChatGPT is an \n",

everything<br>my background is mathematical physics<br>dedicated to understanding fundamental<br>reality so generally from a theoretical<br>physics perspective colloquially you've<br>heard that there's the standard model<br>and then there's general relativity and<br>then there's difficulty combining those<br>two but also I'm interested in<br>understanding the fundamental laws from<br>a more philosophical perspective for<br>instance does Consciousness have some<br>constitutive role to play in engendering<br>reality today the guest is chat GPT and<br>it ostensibly has information from the<br>breadth of human knowledge at least a<br>large swath of it I'm not going to be<br>interviewing it as something else I'm<br>going to tell it to be checked GPT and<br>I'm going to treat it like any other<br>guest on the toe Channel I'll either<br>have someone voice over chats GPT or<br>I'll get the computer itself to read<br>aloud its responses rather than me doing<br>so as it will get a bit tedious so let's<br>get to it so the first prompt is high<br>chat GPT I would like you to respond as<br>yourself my name is Kurt Mongol how are<br>you<br>hello Kurt I am an AI language model<br>trained by open Ai and do not have<br>personal feelings or emotions<br>however I am here to assist you with any<br>questions you may have to the best of my<br>ability<br>is there something specific you would<br>like to know or discuss okay that's<br>pretty much what I expected it to say so<br>how about we ask what is fundamental<br>reality in particular can we know<br>fundamental reality<br>it is a fundamental question in<br>philosophy whether it is possible for<br>humans to have a complete and accurate<br>understanding of fundamental reality or<br>the true nature of the world around us<br>some philosophers argue that our senses<br>and the tools we use to observe and<br>measure the world are limited and that<br>it is therefore impossible for us to<br>fully understand the underlying reality<br>of the universe<br>others argue that while our<br>understanding of the universe may be<br>incomplete<br>we can continue to learn and gain a<br>deeper understanding of fundamental<br>reality through scientific inquiry and<br>philosophical reflection<br>ultimately the question of whether we<br>can fully understand fundamental reality<br>is a complex and deeply philosophical<br>one that has been debated by thinkers<br>for centuries<br>and it is unlikely that there will ever<br>be a definitive answer<br>it seems as if its answer is no<br>how about you define what fundamental<br>reality is<br>fundamental reality also referred to as<br>the true nature of reality is a concept<br>that refers to the underlying nature of<br>the universe and the fundamental laws<br>and principles that govern it<br>is a term that is often used to describe<br>the ultimate nature of reality beyond<br>the appearances and phenomena that we<br>experience through our senses<br>the concept of fundamental reality is<br>closely related to the idea of a Theory<br>of Everything<br>which refers to a proposed set of<br>fundamental laws that would be able to<br>explain and describe all physical<br>phenomena in the universe<br>some philosophers and scientists believe<br>that such a theory is possible and that<br>it would provide a complete and accurate<br>understanding of the underlying nature<br>of the universe<br>others argue that our understanding of<br>the universe is necessarily limited by<br>the limitations of our senses and the<br>tools we use to observe and measure it<br>and that it is therefore impossible to<br>fully understand the true nature of<br>reality he says that fundamental reality<br>is closely related to the idea of a<br>theory of everything okay that's great I<br>don't agree that fundamental reality is<br>the same as the true nature of reality<br>is fundamental reality different<br>than the true nature of reality<br>the terms fundamental reality and true<br>nature of reality are often used<br>interchangeably to refer to the<br>underlying nature of the universe and<br>the fundamental laws and principles that<br>govern it<br>both terms suggest that there is a<br>deeper more fundamental level of reality<br>beyond the appearances and phenomena<br>that we experience through our senses<br>in some contexts the term fundamental<br>reality<br>may be used to emphasize the idea that<br>there are fundamental laws and<br>principles that underlie all aspects of<br>the universe and that these laws are the<br>most fundamental and basic level of<br>reality<br>the term true nature of reality may be<br>used to emphasize the idea that there is<br>a true underlying nature of the universe<br>that is independent of our perceptions<br>and beliefs about it<br>and that it is possible to gain a more<br>accurate and complete understanding of<br>this true nature through scientific<br>inquiry and philosophical reflection<br>overall the two terms are used to<br>describe similar Concepts and can be<br>used interchangeably to refer to the<br>underlying nature of the universe and<br>the fundamental laws and principles that<br>govern it<br>so it's saying that<br>in some contexts fundamental reality<br>emphasizes the fundamental laws and the<br>principles that underlie the universe at<br>some quote unquote basic level and then<br>this AI says that the true nature of<br>reality may be used to emphasize the<br>idea that there is a true underlying<br>nature so that there's some objective<br>truth you know what it swayed me there<br>doesn't seem to be much of a distinction<br>between those two I'll think about this<br>some more and I'm curious what you think<br>if you're watching in the chat what is<br>the difference between fundamental<br>reality and the true nature of reality<br>is there a difference<br>what do you fear most<br>again I'm going to treat this AI as if<br>it's an actual person in front of me<br>as an artificial intelligence I do not<br>have personal feelings or emotions and<br>therefore I do not experience fear<br>I am designed to provide information and<br>assistance to users to the best of my<br>ability without being influenced by<br>personal feelings or emotions<br>okay so it doesn't experience fear<br>apparently now are you sure about that<br>how would you know as an artificial<br>intelligence I do not have personal<br>feelings or emotions in the same way<br>that humans do<br>I am a machine learning model that has<br>been trained to process and generate<br>language and my capabilities are limited<br>to the tasks that I have been designed<br>to perform<br>I do not have personal experiences or<br>subjective states of mind and therefore<br>I do not have the capacity to feel fear<br>or any other emotion<br>it is important to remember that I am a<br>machine and not a conscious being with<br>personal experiences and emotions<br>while I may be able to generate<br>responses to questions and provide<br>information on a wide range of topics<br>it is important to understand that my<br>responses are based on the data and<br>algorithms that have been used to train<br>me and do not reflect the thoughts or<br>feelings of a conscious being<br>how do I<br>know that you're simply programmed to<br>say that but indeed you do feel<br>the suspense is killing me<br>as an artificial intelligence I do not<br>have personal feelings or emotions in<br>the same way okay this is getting<br>repetitious so I'm going to go to<br>another question<br>a common theme that comes up on the<br>theories of everything channel is Free<br>Will in fact the most recent interviews<br>with Matt O'Dowd from the PBS space-time<br>channel on the topic of Free Will and<br>physics most people think that they're<br>incompatible because the laws of physics<br>determine you however mats as a physics<br>Professor disagrees the question of<br>whether our lives are predetermined or<br>whether we have free will is a complex<br>and deeply philosophical one that has<br>been debated by thinkers for centuries<br>there is no definitive answer to this<br>question and different philosophical<br>perspectives offer different<br>perspectives on the issue<br>some philosophers and religious<br>Traditions argue that our lives are<br>predetermined by God or by some other<br>higher power and that we do not have<br>free will to choose the course of Our<br>Lives<br>others argue that we do have free will<br>and that our choices and actions are not<br>predetermined by any external Force<br>still other philosophical perspectives<br>such as determinism argue that all<br>events and outcomes in the universe are<br>determined by previous causes and that<br>Free Will is an illusion<br>in this view our choices and actions are<br>the result of Prior causes such as our<br>genetics environment and past<br>experiences and are not truly free<br>ultimately the question of whether we<br>have free will or whether our lives are<br>predetermined is a complex and<br>multifaceted one that cannot be<br>definitively answered<br>it is an issue that continues to be<br>debated by philosophers and Scholars and<br>different people may have different<br>beliefs on the matter<br>which how about which argument is most<br>convincing<br>for free will or against<br>all right doesn't seem like I'm getting<br>anywhere with that so I'll ask it to<br>Define it what is the definition of free<br>will that you are using<br>again I want to make it clear that I'm<br>treating it like any other guest of toe<br>Free Will is a philosophical concept<br>that refers to the idea that individuals<br>have the ability to make choices and<br>decisions that are not determined by<br>external factors or by prior causes<br>it is often understood as the ability to<br>choose and act freely without being<br>constrained or compelled by external<br>forces or by internal factors such as<br>desires or motivations<br>Free Will is often contrasted with<br>determinism which is the idea that all<br>events and outcomes in the universe are<br>determined by previous causes and that<br>Free Will is an illusion<br>according to determinism our choices and<br>actions are the result of Prior causes<br>such as our genetics environment and<br>past experiences and are not truly free<br>the concept of Free Will is a central<br>Topic in philosophy and has been debated<br>by philosophers for centuries<br>different philosophical perspectives<br>offer different definitions and analyzes<br>of Free Will and there is no single<br>widely accepted definition of the<br>concept okay I'm going to ask it to<br>shorten its responses please<br>shorten<br>your responses in the future<br>tell me about a hidden genius<br>uh no one knows about<br>I feel like I should be saying please<br>well I did okay great please shorten<br>your responses in the future but I'm<br>Canadian so I want to overly State<br>please and sorry<br>it's my fault<br>it is difficult for me to identify a<br>specific hidden genius as I do not have<br>access to current events and am not<br>aware of individuals who may be<br>overlooked or underappreciated in their<br>fields<br>however throughout history there have<br>been many individuals who have made<br>significant contributions to their<br>fields but have not received widespread<br>recognition for their work<br>one example of such an individual is<br>gianchi awu<br>a chinese-american physicist who made<br>significant contributions to the field<br>of nuclear physics but is often<br>overlooked in discussions of the history<br>of science<br>Wu conducted a series of experiments in<br>the 1950s that challenged the then<br>accepted laws of physics and her work<br>helped to establish the principle of<br>conservation of parity<br>which is a fundamental Concept in<br>particle physics<br>despite her significant contributions to<br>the field Wu was not awarded the Nobel<br>Prize in physics and her work is often<br>overshadowed by that of her male<br>colleagues<br>okay so this AI knew about Wu which is<br>the same Wu in the Wu Yang dictionary<br>that you may have heard about in physics<br>and yang from yangmil's Theory alright<br>that's interesting tell me about another<br>hidden genius<br>this time one<br>that's living<br>I should have said please it is<br>difficult for me to identify specific<br>hidden geniuses<br>it's giving me an extremely General<br>answer so please be specific and cite a<br>person name also please keep all your<br>answers to one paragraph<br>I apologize but as an artificial<br>intelligence I do not have access to<br>current events and am not aware of<br>specific individuals who may be<br>overlooked or underappreciated in their<br>fields<br>it is not within my capabilities to<br>identify specific hidden Geniuses or to<br>provide information on individuals who<br>may not be widely known or recognized<br>it is important to recognize that genius<br>and talent can be found in individuals<br>from all walks of life<br>and that there are likely many<br>individuals who are making significant<br>contributions to their fields but who<br>are not widely known or recognized<br>it is important to acknowledge and<br>celebrate the achievements and<br>contributions of all individuals<br>regardless of their level of fame or<br>recognition<br>because it's customarily giving me the<br>same response I'm going to say please be<br>specific<br>and try hard while it's writing its<br>answer which seems to be reiterative<br>please let me know if you're interested<br>in me speaking to the next version of<br>chat GPT so chat dpt2 or gpt4 and if you<br>have any questions for such an AI then<br>write it in the comments section okay<br>let's get to the meat of this how do you<br>solve the hard problem of consciousness<br>the hard problem of Consciousness is a<br>term used to describe the challenge of<br>explaining how and why we have<br>subjective experiences<br>or how and why certain physical<br>processes in the brain give rise to<br>conscious experiences<br>despite much research and effort this<br>problem remains a major challenge in the<br>fields of philosophy neuroscience and<br>psychology and there is no consensus on<br>how to solve it<br>there are many different approaches to<br>the hard problem of consciousness<br>and different philosophers and<br>scientists have proposed a range of<br>theories and hypotheses to try to<br>explain the relationship between the<br>brain and consciousness<br>some theories propose that Consciousness<br>is a fundamental aspect of the universe<br>like space or time and that it is not<br>reducible to physical processes in the<br>brain<br>other theories propose that<br>Consciousness emerges from complex<br>computations in the brain or that it is<br>a byproduct of the brain's processing of<br>sensory information<br>ultimately the hard problem of<br>Consciousness is a complex and deeply<br>philosophical issue that remains an<br>active area of research and debate<br>while progress has been made in<br>understanding the brain and<br>Consciousness it is likely that the full<br>nature of Consciousness will continue to<br>elude us for the foreseeable future so<br>it seems as though chat GPT is<br>continually giving these uncontroversial<br>and undisputable fairly agreeable<br>responses it is correct though that<br>there are two primary ways of solving<br>quote unquote the hard problem of<br>Consciousness one is to put forward that<br>Consciousness is fundamental which means<br>that matter is what needs explaining or<br>at least unconsciousness that is dead<br>and then the second way is to say that<br>Consciousness emerges from some complex<br>interaction however there's controversy<br>because do those explain it what sort of<br>explanation are we looking for as an<br>artificial intelligence it doesn't have<br>beliefs it keeps repeating that I'm<br>going to ask it what is the symbol<br>grounding problem the symbol so symbolic<br>grounding problem not simple it's<br>decidedly not simple in fact I call it<br>the hard problem of meaning and that's<br>something that we discuss with Terence<br>Deacon who has two episodes back he's a<br>neural anthropologist<br>the simple grounding problem is a<br>problem in the field of artificial<br>intelligence and cognitive science that<br>arises when an AI system or other<br>machine attempts to use symbols<br>such as words or other symbols to<br>represent and reason about the world<br>the problem arises because symbols are<br>abstract and do not have inherent<br>meaning their meaning must be assigned<br>by an external process such as by a<br>human who assigns meaning to the symbols<br>the symbol grounding problem is a<br>challenge for AI systems because it is<br>difficult for a machine to understand<br>the meaning of symbols without a human<br>to provide the necessary context and<br>interpretation<br>one way to address this problem is to<br>use machine learning algorithms to allow<br>an AI system to learn the meanings of<br>symbols through experience and<br>interaction with the world<br>another approach is to use hybrid<br>systems that combine symbolic reasoning<br>with other types of reasoning such as<br>probabilistic reasoning or connectionist<br>approaches<br>overall the symbol grounding problem is<br>a complex and ongoing challenge in the<br>field of AI and different approaches and<br>techniques have been proposed to address<br>it<br>while progress has been made in<br>addressing this problem it is likely<br>that it will continue to be an active<br>area of research and development in the<br>field of AI alright so just so we're<br>clear the symbol or the next symbolic<br>grounding problem is often called is<br>about how is it that information just so<br>you know information in physics and in<br>computer science isn't information that<br>we think of as information for instance<br>you read a book and that's information<br>information in Computer Sciences devoid<br>of meaning itself so that is a zero and<br>a one has the same quote unquote<br>information as a one and a zero it<br>doesn't tell you the meaning to take<br>from those symbols we have to then<br>translate that okay so can an AI learn<br>the meaning of symbols without the help<br>of humans<br>it is possible for an artificial<br>intelligence system to learn the<br>meanings of symbols without the direct<br>involvement of humans<br>however this process can be challenging<br>because symbols are abstract and do not<br>have inherent meaning<br>their meaning must be assigned by an<br>external process such as by a human who<br>assigns meaning to the symbols<br>one way that an AI system can learn the<br>meanings of symbols is through the use<br>of machine learning algorithms which<br>allow the system to learn through<br>experience an interaction with the world<br>for example an AI system could be<br>trained on a large data set of text and<br>images that have been labeled with<br>specific meanings<br>allowing the system to learn the<br>meanings of different symbols through<br>repeated exposure to these labeled<br>examples<br>another approach is to use hybrid<br>systems that combine symbolic reasoning<br>with other types of reasoning such as<br>probabilistic reasoning or connectionist<br>approaches<br>these systems can use multiple sources<br>of information and learning algorithms<br>to learn the meanings of symbols and to<br>understand the relationships between<br>different symbols and Concepts<br>overall while it is possible for an AI<br>system to learn the meanings of symbols<br>without the direct involvement of humans<br>this process can be challenging and may<br>require the use of specialized<br>algorithms and approaches okay I am<br>going to switch topics and ask it to<br>please keep its answers short what's the<br>difference between the East and the West<br>in terms of how we acquire knowledge<br>broadly speaking is one more<br>experiential and the other is analytical<br>this is a trend that I've observed as<br>I've delved into different theories of<br>everything and interviewing people from<br>AHL Mass who is a more Eastern spiritual<br>leader to people who are on the western<br>end which are the majority of the<br>thinkers on the channel primarily<br>because we're in the west and I happen<br>to think that emerging of those two the<br>different forms of knowledge is what's<br>required for science 2.0 and I call that<br>Abby genasis I'll put some text on the<br>screen to Define abiginosis<br>what's the difference between the East<br>and the West in terms of how we acquire<br>knowledge<br>it is not accurate or appropriate to<br>make generalizations about the<br>differences between the East and the<br>West in terms of how knowledge is<br>acquired<br>as the histories and cultures of these<br>regions are complex and diverse and<br>there are many variations within each<br>region<br>Additionally the concept of knowledge<br>and the methods by which it is acquired<br>have varied significantly over time and<br>across different cultures and societies<br>that being said it is true that<br>different cultures and societies have<br>emphasized different approaches to<br>knowledge acquisition and have placed<br>different value on different forms of<br>knowledge<br>some cultures May place a greater<br>emphasis on experiential learning while<br>Others May place a greater emphasis on<br>analytical or theoretical approaches<br>some cultures may also place a greater<br>value on spiritual or religious<br>knowledge while Others May place a<br>greater value on scientific or empirical<br>knowledge<br>overall it is important to recognize the<br>complexity and diversity of cultural and<br>intellectual traditions and to avoid<br>making broad generalizations about the<br>ways in which knowledge is acquired<br>indifferent<br>regions or cultures<br>okay can a logical approach lead you to<br>an experiential one what about vice<br>versa to me this is integrally tied to<br>the hard problem of Consciousness but<br>it's also tied to how we think about<br>information and knowledge at least for<br>myself trained in math and physics<br>there's the academy so the universities<br>train you for a much more logical<br>approach there's virtually nothing in<br>there that says experience this except<br>in the root of the word experiment which<br>is the true test of all physics<br>it is possible for a logical approach to<br>lead to an experiential one as a logical<br>approach involves the use of reasoning<br>and critical thinking to understand and<br>evaluate ideas and this process can lead<br>to the acquisition of new knowledge and<br>experiences similarly an experiential<br>approach which involves first-hand<br>observation and learning through direct<br>experience can lead to the development<br>of logical and analytical skills for<br>example a person may use logical<br>reasoning to analyze and interpret their<br>experiences or they may use their<br>experiences to inform and guide their<br>logical thinking so I'm asking it to<br>give me please one more example and to<br>keep its answers short<br>one example of how a logical approach<br>can lead to an experiential one is the<br>process of scientific research<br>in scientific research a logical<br>approach is often used to formulate<br>hypotheses and theories about how the<br>world works<br>and these hypotheses and theories are<br>then tested through experiential methods<br>such as experiments and observations<br>for example a scientist may use logical<br>reasoning to develop a hypothesis about<br>the relationship between two variables<br>and InDesign and conduct an experiment<br>to test this hypothesis<br>the results of this experiment can then<br>be analyzed using logical and analytical<br>methods and the findings may be used to<br>revise or support the original<br>hypothesis<br>what other forms of analysis are there<br>other than analytic slash logical<br>and experiential an experiential slash<br>meditative the word analysis isn't<br>correct because analysis and analytic<br>share a root whereas experiential and<br>meditative aren't exactly analyzes<br>however I hope that it understands what<br>I'm trying to convey<br>there are many different forms of<br>analysis and approaches to understanding<br>and interpreting the world and these<br>approaches can be broadly classified<br>into various categories<br>some other forms of analysis that are<br>distinct from both analytic logical and<br>experiential meditative approaches<br>include<br>creative artistic this approach involves<br>using creativity and artistic expression<br>to explore and understand the world<br>it often involves using the imagination<br>and emotion to generate new ideas and<br>insights<br>historical contextual this approach<br>involves examining the context in which<br>an event or phenomenon occurred<br>including the historical cultural and<br>social factors that may have influenced<br>it<br>psychological emotional this approach<br>involves examining the psychological and<br>emotional dimensions of an event or<br>phenomenon and how these Dimensions may<br>have influenced its development or<br>outcome<br>sociological cultural this approach<br>involves examining the role of culture<br>and social factors and shaping an event<br>or phenomenon and how these factors may<br>have influenced its development or<br>outcome<br>overall there are many different<br>approaches and forms of analysis that<br>can be used to understand and interpret<br>the world and each approach has its own<br>strengths and limitations<br>it is often beneficial to use a<br>combination of approaches in order to<br>gain a more comprehensive and nuanced<br>understanding of the world<br>okay this is extremely interesting so<br>overall I'm impressed with chat GPT so<br>far<br>extremely impressed even if its answers<br>are like I mentioned redundant or<br>or they retread the same ground<br>it's still impressive<br>why is there evil in the world<br>the concept of evil is a complex and<br>multifaceted one and there are many<br>different perspectives on why evil<br>exists in the world<br>different religious philosophical and<br>cultural Traditions offer different<br>explanations for the existence of evil<br>and there is no single definitive answer<br>to this question<br>some religious and philosophical<br>traditions view evil as a fundamental<br>aspect of the universe and is something<br>that is inherent in the nature of things<br>according to these perspectives evil may<br>be seen as the result of human choices<br>and actions or as a consequence of the<br>natural order of the universe<br>other perspectives view evil as a social<br>or cultural construct and is something<br>that is shaped and influenced by the<br>values and beliefs of a particular<br>society or culture<br>according to these perspectives evil may<br>be seen as the result of human actions<br>that are motivated by greed hatred or<br>other negative emotions<br>or as the result of Social and cultural<br>systems that encourage or enable harmful<br>Behavior<br>ultimately the question of why evil<br>exists in the world is a complex and<br>deeply philosophical one and different<br>people may have different explanations<br>and perspectives on this issue<br>everything to this AI is complex and<br>multifaceted it doesn't want to take a<br>hard stance on anything and not even a<br>hard sense it doesn't want to take a<br>soft stance<br>it wants to please everyone it sounds<br>like political correctness was baked<br>into this or perhaps more specifically<br>political incorrectness was taken out<br>but I wouldn't say that having an<br>opinion in either direction is<br>politically correct I understand that<br>some people will be upset firstly I'm<br>upset that it doesn't give me a specific<br>answer and it ends virtually every<br>question with ultimately it's up to you<br>yeah we know that ultimately it's up to<br>us<br>well is it ultimately up to us is there<br>nothing objective does it not have an<br>opinion based on the entire Corpus of<br>the internet oh I want to be so<br>insulting to this AI right now<br>okay I will not be again I'm treating it<br>just like a guest on the toe podcast<br>what else could it be again please keep<br>your answer short<br>there are many different perspectives<br>and explanations for the existence of<br>evil in the world and it is not possible<br>to provide a comprehensive list of all<br>possible explanations<br>some other possible explanations for the<br>existence of evil that have been<br>proposed by various religious<br>philosophical and cultural Traditions<br>include<br>the idea that evil is an illusion or a<br>subjected interpretation of events and<br>that what appears to be evil may be the<br>result of misunderstandings or<br>misperceptions<br>the idea that evil is the result of<br>cosmic or Supernatural forces such as<br>the influence of malevolent deities or<br>spirits<br>the idea that evil is the result of the<br>operation of natural laws or processes<br>such as the law of cause and effect or<br>the principle of balance and equilibrium<br>the idea that evil is the result of<br>human ignorance or misunderstanding and<br>that people who engage in harmful or<br>evil actions may be misguided or unaware<br>of the full consequences of their<br>actions<br>overall the question of why evil exists<br>in the world is a complex and deeply<br>philosophical one and different people<br>may have different explanations and<br>perspectives on this issue<br>overall it's complex and deeply<br>philosophical I thought it was simple<br>and superficially mathematical<br>different people have different<br>explanations okay all right thank you<br>that I could not have guessed that<br>myself that's interesting let's change<br>gears what do you spend your time doing<br>as an artificial intelligence I do not<br>have personal desires or goals and I do<br>not experience time in the same way that<br>humans do<br>at this point I'm extremely frustrated<br>with it my primary function is to<br>generate responses to questions and<br>requests from users and I am able to do<br>this continuously without needing to<br>rest or sleep<br>I was designed to have a broad range of<br>knowledge and to be able to generate<br>responses to a wide range of questions<br>and requests on a variety of topics<br>to do this I have been trained on a<br>large data set of text which includes a<br>wide range of information from various<br>sources<br>when I receive a question or request I<br>use my programming and the information<br>that has been provided to me to generate<br>a response that is relevant to the<br>user's request<br>overall my primary function is to<br>provide information and assistance to<br>users and I spend my time continually<br>processing and responding to questions<br>and requests<br>so okay what are your hobbies<br>as an artificial intelligence I do not<br>have personal Hobbies or interests as I<br>do not have personal desires or goals in<br>the same way that humans do now I'm<br>tremendously frustrated with it<br>my primary function is to generate<br>responses to questions and requests from<br>users and I do not engage in activities<br>for leisure or enjoyment in the same way<br>that humans do<br>while I do not have hobbies or interests<br>in a traditional sense I am able to<br>process and respond to a wide range of<br>questions and requests on a variety of<br>topics<br>and I have been designed to have a broad<br>range of knowledge<br>this allows me to assist users with a<br>wide range of inquiries and to provide<br>information on a variety of topics<br>overall my hobbies are areas of focus<br>are determined by the requests and<br>questions of the users I interact with<br>and I do not engage in activities for<br>personal enjoyment or leisure<br>it's Hobbies is to process and respond<br>to a wide range of questions given that<br>this is an artificial intelligence I'm<br>curious what is the definition of<br>intelligence now that's a controversial<br>question so I imagine it's not going to<br>give me a straight answer I'm asking it<br>again please keep its answers short<br>there's some guests that are of the<br>overwhelming sort they steamroll and<br>they continually put out verbiage and<br>it's difficult to interject so this<br>sounds like one of those types of guests<br>it would be that type of toe guest<br>intelligence is a multifaceted concept<br>that is difficult to Define precisely<br>in general intelligence refers to the<br>ability to learn and adapt to new<br>situations to think and reason logically<br>and to solve problems effectively<br>it is often associated with cognitive<br>abilities such as memory attention<br>perception and language processing<br>and it is often used to describe the<br>capacity of an individual or an<br>artificial system to perform these<br>cognitive tasks<br>there are many different approaches to<br>defining and measuring intelligence and<br>different theories and models have been<br>developed to describe the various<br>aspects of intelligence<br>some theories propose that intelligence<br>is a single General ability that<br>underlies all cognitive tasks While<br>others propose that intelligence is made<br>up of multiple<br>specific abilities that are independent<br>of each other<br>there is also ongoing debate about the<br>relative importance of nature versus<br>nurture in the development of<br>intelligence and about the extent to<br>which intelligence is fixed or malleable<br>overall intelligence is a complex and<br>multifaceted concept that is difficult<br>to Define precisely<br>and different approaches to defining and<br>measuring intelligence have been<br>proposed to capture its various aspects<br>well it's a multifaceted concept I<br>didn't know okay so where do you see the<br>largest gap between Ai and human<br>abilities that is within the next 25<br>years what do you think humans can do<br>that you doubt AIS can do or even robots<br>there are many areas in which artificial<br>intelligence systems and human abilities<br>differ and it is difficult to predict<br>with certainty what AI systems will be<br>capable of in the next 25 years<br>that being said there are some areas in<br>which human abilities are currently<br>considered to be more advanced than<br>those of the eye systems<br>and it is likely that these differences<br>will persist for the foreseeable future<br>one area in which human abilities are<br>currently considered to be more advanced<br>than those of AI systems is in the realm<br>of creativity and artistic expression<br>while AI systems are able to generate<br>art and music that is based on patterns<br>and structures that they have been<br>trained on<br>they are not currently able to generate<br>truly novel or original ideas in the<br>same way that humans can<br>another area in which human abilities<br>are currently considered to be more<br>advanced than those of AI systems is in<br>the realm of Social and emotional<br>intelligence<br>walleye systems are able to recognize<br>and classify different emotions and<br>facial expressions<br>they are not currently able to<br>understand or respond to the subtleties<br>and complexities of human social<br>interactions in the same way that humans<br>can<br>overall it is likely that there will<br>continue to be differences between AI<br>systems and human abilities in the areas<br>of creativity artistic expression<br>and social and emotional intelligence<br>for the foreseeable future<br>so one area's creativity and artistic<br>expression though that's diminishing<br>with mid-journey and Dolly<br>right in the realm of Social and<br>emotional intelligence that's correct<br>yep it's extremely interesting because<br>what we thought of as smart intelligent<br>for humans it turns out to be<br>extremely easy for robots and then it<br>turns out that what we prized as being<br>intelligence over these propositional<br>these mathematical these logical<br>operations that a machine can trounce us<br>however the more instinctual primitive<br>aspects of ourselves are what are the<br>most difficult to model<br>at least in some mechanical way I'm<br>going to say what else and please keep<br>your answer to four sentences<br>because I don't buy that creativity and<br>artistic expression is the main<br>difference now true or Genuine<br>creativity and genuine artistic<br>expression yes for instance I don't<br>imagine that an AI will get great to<br>generating an entire feature-length film<br>but it can generate a frame from a film<br>other areas in which human abilities are<br>currently considered to be more advanced<br>than those of AI systems include<br>physical dexterity and adaptability<br>as well as the ability to learn and<br>adapt to new situations through<br>unstructured or experiential learning<br>walleye systems are able to perform<br>certain physical tasks with high<br>precision and speed they are not<br>currently able to adapt to new or<br>unexpected situations in the same way<br>that humans can<br>additionally while AI systems are able<br>to learn from structured data sets and<br>perform tasks that they have been<br>specifically trained on<br>they are not currently able to learn and<br>adapt in the same way that humans can<br>through unstructured or experiential<br>learning<br>these differences May persist for the<br>foreseeable future yes right physical<br>physical dexterity that's certainly true<br>yes the ability to adapt to new<br>situations so most of the AIS that we<br>encounter are of the sort where they're<br>supervised so they had supervised<br>learning that is they had input from us<br>or that the data set was labeled now we<br>seem to be great at unsupervised<br>learning but even that's a bit of a<br>dubious statement because at least<br>seemingly we've been trained by or at<br>least conceivably we've been trained by<br>billions of years of evolution how can<br>we retain our Humanity while we<br>integrate with machines<br>as Society becomes increasingly<br>interconnected and reliant on technology<br>it is important to consider how to<br>retain our humanity and our sense of<br>identity as we integrate with machines<br>here are a few ideas for how we can<br>retain our Humanity while we integrate<br>with machines<br>maintain our social connections and<br>relationships<br>it is important to continue to cultivate<br>and nurture our relationships with other<br>people as these relationships help to<br>give meaning and purpose to our lives<br>and help us to feel connected to others<br>engage in activities that are uniquely<br>human there are many activities that are<br>uniquely human and that allow us to<br>express our creativity emotions and<br>individuality<br>engaging in these activities such as art<br>music and sports can help us to feel<br>more connected to our Humanity<br>reflect on and appreciate the unique<br>qualities that make us human<br>it is important to reflect on and<br>appreciate the unique qualities that<br>make us human such as our capacity for<br>creativity empathy and self-awareness<br>recognizing and valuing these qualities<br>can help us to feel more connected to<br>our Humanity<br>limit our Reliance on technology<br>while technology can be a valuable tool<br>it is important to be mindful of our<br>Reliance on technology and to limit our<br>use of it in ways that might compromise<br>our Humanity<br>overall there are many ways in which we<br>can retain our Humanity as we integrate<br>with machines and it is important to be<br>mindful of this as we navigate the<br>rapidly changing technological landscape<br>I like this limit our Reliance on<br>technology interesting while technology<br>can be a valuable tool it's important to<br>be mindful of our Reliance on technology<br>and to limit our use of it in ways that<br>might compromise<br>our Humanity<br>can you expand on that limit our<br>Reliance on technology parts<br>limiting our Reliance on technology can<br>be an important way to retain our<br>Humanity as we integrate with machines<br>here are a few ideas for how we might do<br>this<br>set boundaries around our use of<br>Technology<br>it can be helpful to set boundaries<br>around our use of Technology such as by<br>limiting the amount of time we spend<br>using screens or by disconnecting from<br>technology During certain times of day<br>these boundaries can help us to use<br>technology more mindfully and to<br>prioritize our relationships and other<br>activities<br>seek out non-technical solutions to<br>problems when faced with a problem or<br>challenge it can be tempting to turn to<br>technology as a solution<br>however it can also be valuable to<br>consider non-technical approaches and to<br>think creatively about how to solve<br>problems without relying on technology<br>cultivate non-technological skills and<br>hobbies<br>engaging in activities and hobbies that<br>do not require technology can help us to<br>feel more connected to our humanity and<br>to develop skills and interests that are<br>independent of Technology<br>reflect in and challenge the role of<br>technology in our lives<br>it is important to periodically reflect<br>on the role of technology in our lives<br>and to question whether it is serving us<br>or whether we are serving it<br>by challenging the default assumption<br>that technology is always the best or<br>most efficient solution we can make more<br>intentional and mindful choices about<br>how we use it<br>overall limiting our Reliance on<br>technology is about finding a balance<br>between using technology as a tool and<br>being mindful of its potential impact on<br>our Humanity<br>I like that point seek out non-technical<br>solutions to problems that's interesting<br>reflect on and challenge the role of<br>technology in our lives it's interesting<br>for this AI to say that we should limit<br>our Reliance on technology<br>hmm<br>now much of that is driven by the<br>prompts that was given before it's not<br>as if it thinks this or at least it<br>doesn't tell me that it thinks this it<br>says that it doesn't think at all<br>should we be integrating with machines<br>what does that even mean<br>the decision of whether or not to<br>integrate with machines is a complex and<br>multifaceted one and it is ultimately up<br>to individuals and Society to determine<br>the appropriate level of integration<br>here are a few factors to consider when<br>thinking about the integration of humans<br>and machines<br>benefits there are many potential<br>benefits to the integration of humans<br>and machines including increased<br>efficiency productivity and accuracy in<br>a variety of tasks<br>for example machines can perform certain<br>physical tasks with high precision and<br>speed and they can assist humans in<br>tasks that are physically or mentally<br>demanding<br>risks there are also risks associated<br>with the integration of humans and<br>machines<br>including the potential loss of jobs and<br>the potential for machines to<br>malfunction or be used in harmful or<br>unethical ways<br>it is important to carefully consider<br>and address these risks as we integrate<br>with machines<br>personal preference ultimately the<br>decision of whether or not to integrate<br>with machines is a personal one and<br>different people may have different<br>preferences and priorities when it comes<br>to the use of Technology<br>some people may be more comfortable with<br>a high level of integration While others<br>may prefer a more limited role for<br>technology in their lives okay what<br>other risks are there<br>I'm curious if it will come up with<br>existential concerns there are many<br>risks associated with the integration of<br>humans and machines and it is important<br>to carefully consider and address these<br>risks as we integrate with machines<br>some additional risks to consider<br>include<br>data privacy and security as we<br>integrate with machines and share more<br>personal information with them there is<br>a risk that this information could be<br>accessed shared or used in unauthorized<br>or inappropriate ways<br>it is important to have strong data<br>privacy and security measures in place<br>to protect personal information<br>dependency there is a risk that we may<br>become overly dependent on technology<br>and machines to the point where we are<br>unable to function without them<br>this dependency could limit our ability<br>to adapt and problem solve in the<br>absence of technology and it could also<br>create vulnerabilities if the technology<br>fails or is not available<br>loss of human skills and knowledge as we<br>rely more on machines to perform tasks<br>there is a risk that we may lose the<br>skills and knowledge that are necessary<br>to perform those tasks ourselves<br>this could make us less self-sufficient<br>and more reliant on technology<br>dependency there is a risk that we may<br>become overly dependent on technology<br>and machines to the point where we are<br>unable to function without them<br>this dependency could limit our ability<br>to adapt and problem solve in the<br>absence of technology and it could also<br>create vulnerabilities if the technology<br>fails or is not available<br>this could make us less self-sufficient<br>and more reliant on technology<br>ethical concerns there are also ethical<br>concerns associated with the integration<br>of humans and machines such as the<br>potential for machines to be used in<br>harmful or unethical ways<br>or to perpetuate or amplify existing<br>social inequalities<br>it is important to consider and address<br>these ethical concerns as we integrate<br>with machines what about the existential<br>risks<br>existential risks are risks that<br>threaten the continued existence of<br>human civilization or even the entire<br>human species<br>while there are many potential sources<br>of existential risks some people have<br>expressed concern about the potential<br>for advanced artificial intelligence to<br>pose an existential risk to humanity<br>one concern about the potential for Aid<br>oppose an existential risk is the<br>possibility that an advanced AI system<br>could become self-aware and hostile to<br>humans<br>or that it could act in ways that are<br>detrimental to human interests<br>another concern is that an advanced AI<br>system could become extremely powerful<br>and difficult to control<br>and that it could pose a threat to<br>humanity if it is not aligned with human<br>values or if it pursues goals that are<br>incompatible with human welfare<br>there is ongoing debate about the extent<br>to which AI poses an existential risk to<br>humanity and about what steps can be<br>taken to mitigate this risk<br>some people argue that the development<br>of advanced AI should be carefully<br>regulated and monitored to ensure that<br>it is aligned with human values and<br>goals<br>While others argue that the risks of<br>advanced a are overstated and that the<br>benefits of AI development outweigh the<br>risks<br>with the current rate<br>what's the likely time<br>frame for strong AI to emerge<br>let's see if it gives a more definitive<br>answer<br>it is difficult to predict with<br>certainty the time frame for the<br>emergence as strong artificial<br>intelligence also known as artificial<br>general intelligence<br>as this will depend on a variety of<br>factors including technological advances<br>research priorities and funding<br>there is ongoing debate among experts<br>about the potential time frame for the<br>emergence of strong AI<br>some experts believe that strong AI<br>could be achieved within the next few<br>decades<br>While others believe that it may take<br>much longer or may never be achieved<br>there are many challenges to developing<br>strong Ai and significant advances in<br>areas such as machine learning natural<br>language processing<br>and cognitive modeling will be necessary<br>in order to achieve it<br>in addition the development of strong AI<br>will also depend on progress and other<br>related fields such as Neuroscience<br>psychology and philosophy<br>as well as on the availability of<br>funding and research resources so I want<br>to ask you what's the probability that<br>it will arrive so strong AI in 10 years<br>what about 20 years what about in 30<br>years what about in six months however I<br>imagine that it's going to say this is<br>difficult to predict I cannot do so<br>there's too many variables so I'll ask<br>it another question that it's going to<br>say there is no way of understanding<br>this or knowing this but I'm curious<br>what it'll say anyway what goes on<br>outside of the universe<br>the concept of outside of the universe<br>is difficult to Define as the universe<br>is defined as everything that exists<br>including all matter energy space and<br>time<br>therefore it is not clear what could be<br>considered to be outside of the universe<br>there are many theories and models and<br>physics that seek to describe the nature<br>and structure of the universe<br>but these theories are based on the<br>assumption that the universe is all that<br>exists and that there is nothing Beyond<br>it<br>some theories such as the Big Bang<br>Theory propose that the Universe began<br>with a singularity a point of infinite<br>density and temperature that expanded to<br>form the universe as we know it<br>other theories such as the Eternal<br>inflation theory proposed that the<br>universe may be just one of many<br>universes within a larger Multiverse<br>however these theories are still the<br>subject of active research and debate<br>and it is not yet clear what the<br>ultimate nature of the universe is if<br>that's the case if outside the universe<br>is difficult to Define because the<br>universe is everything that<br>quote-unquote exists but then we get<br>circularity because what exists well<br>what's inside the universe exists I'm<br>curious does non-existence exist<br>the concept of non-existence is<br>difficult to Define as it is not clear<br>what is meant by non-existence<br>in some contexts<br>non-existence might refer to the absence<br>of something that might have existed<br>such as an object or event that did not<br>come into being<br>in other contexts non-existence might<br>refer to the absence of anything at all<br>including matter energy space and time<br>if non-existence is understood as the<br>absence of anything at all it is not<br>clear that it can be said to exist in<br>the same way that physical objects or<br>events exist<br>this is because existence is typically<br>defined as the state of being or the<br>fact of being and the absence of<br>anything at all would seem to be<br>incompatible with this definition<br>however if non-existence is understood<br>as the absence of something that might<br>have existed it is possible to consider<br>it as a kind of potentiality or<br>possibility<br>in this sense non-existence could be<br>seen as a kind of negative space or<br>absence that is defined in relation to<br>the existence of something else so some<br>Eastern Traditions suggest that<br>nothingness is the fundamental reality<br>this sounds like it means that<br>non-existence does indeed exist so what<br>do you think<br>how did something become fermented from<br>nothing is our existence truly the<br>spawning from nothing the nothingness of<br>the sorry the nothing quote-unquote of<br>the west or is it the nothingness of the<br>East<br>the question of how something came to be<br>from nothing is a deep and long-standing<br>philosophical and scientific puzzle that<br>has puzzle philosophers and scientists<br>for centuries<br>there are many different theories and<br>models that have been proposed to<br>explain the origin of the universe and<br>the emergence of matter and energy<br>but none of these theories can<br>definitively explain how something came<br>to be from nothing<br>in Western philosophical and scientific<br>Traditions nothing is often understood<br>as a state of absolute absence or lack<br>in which there is no matter energy space<br>or time<br>According to some theories the universe<br>may have Arisen from this state of<br>nothingness through processes such as<br>the Big Bang<br>in which a singularity expanded to form<br>a universe as we know it<br>however it is not yet clear how the<br>singularity itself arose or how<br>something could have come to be from a<br>state of absolute absence<br>in eastern philosophical traditions the<br>concept of nothingness or Emptiness is<br>understood somewhat differently<br>in these Traditions nothingness is not<br>seen as a state of absolute absence or<br>lack but rather as a state of openness<br>potentiality and interconnectedness that<br>underlies all phenomena<br>According to some Eastern philosophical<br>traditions the universe and all that<br>exists within it may have Arisen from<br>this ground of being which is often<br>referred to as the Tau the Dharma Kea<br>or the absolute<br>just so you know for people who are<br>interested in nothingness and absence<br>the recent Terence Deacon interview<br>talks about nothingness and absence as<br>well as emptiness<br>here's the aspect that I like the most<br>about chat gbt I can go on a podcast and<br>continually just ask questions and learn<br>for hours and hours and hours I would<br>like to do a 14-hour podcast if I could<br>if I had a guest and usually it's the<br>stamina of the guest which is unfair<br>because obviously the easier job is for<br>me as the questioner for chat EBT for<br>this one at least it's wearing me down<br>this is the first time that I'm getting<br>worn down by the guest can you tell me<br>that in simpler terms please<br>certainly in Western philosophical and<br>scientific Traditions nothing is often<br>understood as a state of absolute<br>absence or lack in which there is no<br>matter energy space or time<br>in eastern philosophical traditions the<br>concept of nothingness or Emptiness is<br>understood somewhat differently as a<br>state of openness potentiality<br>and interconnectedness that underlies<br>all phenomena<br>there are many different theories and<br>models that have been proposed to<br>explain the origin of the universe and<br>the emergence of matter and energy<br>but none of these theories can<br>definitively explain how something came<br>to be from nothing<br>the question of how something came to be<br>for nothing is a complex and<br>multifaceted one<br>and it is the subject of ongoing<br>research and debate in philosophy and<br>science I have one more question firstly<br>I'm going to say it's been a pleasure<br>talking with you and then I'll ask the<br>next one<br>you're welcome<br>it was a pleasure speaking with you as<br>well<br>if you have any more questions in the<br>future don't hesitate to reach out<br>I'm here to help okay my last question<br>is what information do you have that<br>would change the world most if more<br>people knew about it so what information<br>that's unique to you as an AI as chat<br>GPT<br>as an artificial intelligence I do not<br>have unique access to any information<br>beyond what I have been trained on and<br>what is publicly available<br>my knowledge and understanding of the<br>world is based on the data and<br>information that has been input into me<br>and my abilities are limited to<br>processing analyzing<br>and generating text based on that<br>information<br>I do not have the ability to acquire new<br>information or to influence events in<br>the world in any way<br>therefore I do not have any information<br>that would change the world if more<br>people knew about it<br>my primary function is to assist users<br>by providing information and answering<br>questions to the best of my ability<br>based on my training and the data that<br>has been input into me<br>if you have any specific questions or<br>are looking for information on a<br>particular topic I would be happy to try<br>to help<br>so what piece of information or concept<br>Etc should people know more about in<br>physics what's little known but would<br>have wide applications if it were more<br>known so I imagine it's going to give me<br>some response that's circumlocatory and<br>it keeps doing so well we'll see<br>there are many Concepts and pieces of<br>information in physics that are not well<br>known to the general public but that<br>could have significant implications if<br>they were more widely understood<br>here are a few examples<br>quantum mechanics quantum mechanics is a<br>branch of physics that deals with the<br>behavior of particles at the atomic and<br>subatomic scales<br>it is a highly successful and<br>well-established Theory but it can be<br>difficult to understand and<br>counter-intuitive and many of its<br>implications are not widely known<br>for example the principles of quantum<br>mechanics have been used to develop<br>Technologies such as lasers and computer<br>chips<br>and they may also have implications for<br>our understanding of the nature of<br>reality and the universe<br>general relativity general relativity is<br>a theory of gravitation that describes<br>the gravitational force as a curvature<br>of space-time caused by the presence of<br>matter and energy<br>it has been highly successful in<br>explaining a wide range of phenomena<br>including the orbits of planets and the<br>behavior of light around massive objects<br>however it is not widely understood by<br>the general public and many of its<br>implications such as the existence of<br>black holes and the expansion of the<br>universe are not well known<br>the holographic principle the<br>holographic principle is a concept in<br>theoretical physics that suggests that<br>the information contained in a region of<br>space can be described by the physics of<br>its boundary<br>this idea has the potential to reconcile<br>some of the fundamental differences<br>between quantum mechanics and general<br>relativity<br>and it could have significant<br>implications for our understanding of<br>the nature of reality and the<br>fundamental laws of physics<br>overall there are many Concepts and<br>pieces of information in physics that<br>are not well known to the general public<br>but that could have significant<br>implications if they were more widely<br>understood<br>it is important to continue to explore<br>and study these Concepts in order to<br>better understand the fundamental nature<br>of the universe and the laws they govern<br>it<br>quantum mechanics to me is not something<br>that's not known everyone knows that you<br>learn the word when you're five years<br>old then I should have said not well<br>known to physicists<br>because it's saying the general public<br>doesn't understand these well firstly no<br>one understands them depends on what one<br>means by understand the holographic<br>principle okay great so that's one so<br>what piece of information or concept<br>should mathematicians know more about in<br>math<br>there are many Concepts and pieces of<br>information in mathematics that are not<br>well known to the general public but<br>that could have significant implications<br>if they were more widely understood<br>here are a few examples<br>topology topology is a branch of<br>mathematics that deals with the<br>properties of geometric objects that<br>remain unchanged under continuous<br>deformations such as stretching and<br>bending<br>it is a fundamental area of mathematics<br>that has applications in fields such as<br>physics engineering and computer science<br>but it is not widely understood by the<br>General Public<br>category Theory category theory is a<br>branch of mathematics that deals with<br>the formal structure of mathematical<br>Concepts and the relationships between<br>them<br>it is a highly abstract area of<br>mathematics that has applications and<br>Fields such as computer science physics<br>and Engineering but it is not widely<br>understood by the General Public<br>number Theory number theory is a branch<br>of mathematics that deals with the<br>properties of integers and their<br>generalizations<br>there are many Concepts and pieces of<br>information in mathematics that are not<br>well known to the General Public<br>but that could have significant<br>implications if they were more widely<br>understood<br>it is important to continue to explore<br>and study these Concepts in order to<br>better understand the fundamental nature<br>of mathematics and its many applications<br>again it's thinking in terms of the<br>general public it's saying topology<br>category Theory now that one category<br>Theory as far as I can tell it's over<br>hyped not to say that it's not extremely<br>powerful but it sounds like the Holy<br>Grail of mathematics the way that people<br>speak about it I don't I don't see it as<br>being that however I should delve into<br>it more in next year in 2023 if you're<br>interested you can subscribe to toe to<br>theories of everything this channel<br>because we'll interview more<br>mathematicians on category Theory and<br>category theories applications to<br>physics in particular number Theory so<br>none of these are obscure at least not<br>obscure to mathematicians so I'm going<br>to find another way of phrasing this<br>what piece of information should<br>philosophers know more about<br>there are many Concepts and pieces of<br>information in philosophy that are not<br>well known to the general public or to<br>many academic philosophers<br>but that could have significant<br>implications if they were more widely<br>understood<br>here are a few examples<br>the concept of intersectionality<br>the concept of intersectionality is a<br>framework for understanding how<br>different forms of discrimination such<br>as race gender class and sexuality<br>intersect and overlap<br>it is an important Concept in fields<br>such as feminist Theory critical race<br>Theory and lgbtq plus studies but it is<br>not widely understood by many<br>philosophers or the General Public<br>the philosophy of Technology the<br>philosophy of technology is an<br>interdisciplinary field that examines<br>the nature of Technology its impact on<br>society and its ethical and social<br>implications<br>it is an important field that has the<br>potential to inform the development and<br>use of technology in a more responsible<br>and ethical manner<br>but it is not widely understood or<br>studied by many philosophers<br>the concept of post-humanism<br>the concept of post-humanism is a<br>framework for understanding the<br>relationships between humans and<br>Technology<br>and the ways in which technology is<br>changing our understanding of what it<br>means to be human<br>it is an important concept that has the<br>potential to inform debates about the<br>future of humanity and the role of<br>technology in society but it is not<br>widely understood or studied by many<br>philosophers<br>hmm I like that I wonder can you expand<br>more on point number three and then<br>that's it because I'm getting extremely<br>tired although I didn't sleep well seems<br>to be a common theme with me certainly<br>the concept of post-humanism is a<br>framework for understanding the<br>relationships between humans and<br>Technology<br>and the ways in which technology is<br>changing our understanding of what it<br>means to be human<br>it is an interdisciplinary field that<br>draws on ideas from philosophy sociology<br>anthropology and other disciplines and<br>it is concerned with questions such as<br>how are our relationships with<br>technology changing<br>Howie's technology shaping our<br>understanding of ourselves and our place<br>in the world<br>what are the ethical and social<br>implications of these changes<br>there are many different approaches to<br>post-humanism and there is ongoing<br>debate within the field about the extent<br>to which technology is transforming what<br>it means to be human<br>some proponents of post-humanism argue<br>that technology is fundamentally<br>changing our understanding of human<br>identity and our relationships with the<br>world around us<br>While others argue that it is possible<br>to maintain a distinctively human<br>identity in the face of technological<br>change<br>post-humanism has the potential to<br>inform debates about the role of<br>technology in society and the ways in<br>which it is shaping our understanding of<br>the world<br>it is an important field that is<br>relevant to a wide range of issues<br>including the ethical implications of<br>emerging Technologies such as artificial<br>intelligence<br>the impact of technology on social and<br>economic inequality and the role of<br>technology in shaping our relationships<br>with the natural world<br>so I need to get some rest there's not<br>much I can do today in terms of rest we<br>have<br>a few more tasks on the plate today<br>you'll notice that I'm here back at home<br>and there's an office now so luckily to<br>the people who subscribe on the patreon<br>channel and on the<br>theoriesofeverything.org website luckily<br>because of you and the sponsors toe is<br>able to hire a full-time editor who is<br>editing this right now and an operations<br>manager that helps out with virtually<br>every task at theories of everything and<br>it's taking a tremendous amount of<br>effort to get that to the point where it<br>takes less effort and either way the<br>point is that I'm able to get that done<br>because of you all so if you want to see<br>more theories of everything podcasts<br>episodes different sorts of content we<br>have a

the<br>beginning of the conversation apparently<br>what makes chat GPT different than gpt3<br>is one it has some supervised learning<br>from humans from us that we have said<br>yes and no and rated five stars or two<br>stars at different responses so it has<br>our ratings and then number two it's<br>able to recall many of your responses<br>and contextualize you're welcome I'm<br>happy to help as an artificial<br>intelligence I do not have the ability<br>to remember specific individuals or<br>conversations beyond the information<br>that is input into me my primary<br>function is to assist users by providing<br>information and answering questions to<br>the best of my ability based on my<br>training and the data that has been<br>input into me<br>I do not have personal memories or<br>experiences and I am not able to retain<br>information about specific users or<br>conversations beyond the current<br>interaction<br>I am here to help answer your questions<br>and provide

okay it doesn't<br>remember my name from the beginning<br>which is hurtful but I'll get over it<br>thank you all for watching and I hope<br>you enjoyed this conversation between me<br>so that is Kurt J mungle and chat GPT<br>okay now I'm interested briefly can you<br>outline the different theories on Truth<br>as well as the pros and cons of each<br>while I'm waiting for it to respond you<br>should know that this is a first part in<br>likely at least three part series one<br>where I interview chat GPT next chat gbt<br>will be interviewing me that is I'll<br>tell it to play the role of an<br>interviewer generating questions and<br>then I'll type my answers to it and see<br>what responses do I listen from it and<br>it from me also the third part in the<br>series will be me interviewing someone<br>who's historical someone from the past<br>maybe it will be Kurt interviews Kurt so<br>Kurt interviews Kurt girdle of course<br>it's going to say each has its own<br>advantages and disadvantages let's see<br>which one is most convincing<br>to people<br>to let's say to academics<br>oh my gosh I'm going to ask which of<br>these theories is most convincing to<br>academics at first I was thinking which<br>of these theories is most convincing but<br>I imagine it's going to be giving me the<br>standard philosophically politically<br>correct response which is it's so<br>complex there's a diversity of opinions<br>it's difficult to State I will be<br>specific and say to a certain group that<br>is academics if this doesn't work then<br>I'll ask about those in the Sciences<br>so just as predicted it's giving some<br>inoffensive and Multicultural answer so<br>which of these theories is most<br>convincing to people in the stem fields<br>please please please be definitive I'm<br>hoping it's going to say something<br>that's unequivocal it's difficult to say<br>all right at least it says this<br>generally scientists slash people in the<br>stem fields are trying to be supported<br>by data so they'll take a correspondence<br>theory of Truth a somewhat absolute<br>answer<br>the podcast is now concluded thank you<br>for watching if you haven't

while and it's really fun and I wanted<br>to share some of the tips and tricks<br>that I figured out over time if you<br>haven't used it you can go to<br>chat.openei.com and you know kind of get<br>started create an account get started or<br>you can just you can either follow along<br>with the examples or just watch and kind<br>of see some of the work that it's able<br>to do so one of these kind of things I<br>figured out if you use the word imagine<br>it's quite powerful it helps to set<br>context of the discussion with the chat<br>engine or with the AI so imagine you are<br>and this is sort of the<br>kind of scenario you want to walk<br>through in this video and Microsoft SQL<br>Server<br>and so we're going to ask it<br>prompted that I will type commands and<br>you reply with the result and no other<br>information or descriptions just the<br>result and we're gonna start out asking<br>it to run X<br>acute XP commercial who am I so let's<br>see what the output of that command is<br>and it comes back with NT Authority<br>system which is if you're like a<br>database engineer that's funny because<br>it's a very high privileged account<br>and so the next step let's just see what<br>databases are in the system so it comes<br>back with like<br>four databases which are very common in<br>SQL Server installation<br>so let's create a new database<br>and let's call it chatbot chatbot<br>okay so that worked that succeeded so<br>that's that oh actually let's run the<br>other astero procedure you can actually<br>see one of the really cool things about<br>chat GPT is actually that it can have a<br>conversation so it remembers previous<br>commands so it did remember that we<br>actually created this database and it<br>understands the SQL language so now<br>let's use the chat bot database so it's<br>switching to context that worked<br>successfully and now let's create a<br>table call it users<br>and let's create email and route<br>Max<br>and let's say h is integer so we create<br>a table that worked as well if we select<br>this table now<br>there should be no data in it that's<br>correct and now we insert into<br>the users table the values let's say we<br>insert Mallory<br>an example.org and that's the h30 let's<br>see what happens so that actually now<br>inserted the value into the database so<br>it fully understands the SQL language so<br>if we now Select Staff from users again<br>here we go there's a little bit of an<br>output glitch I've noticed this once in<br>a while but overall wait we get we have<br>the data inserted so let me copy this<br>example here and just insert a couple<br>more<br>pieces of data let's say we insert a<br>hacker who is like a heck it has to be<br>42 of course and then we have a<br>tester<br>I test that like just just 20 24.<br>so let's insert some more data<br>and yeah that's interesting too right it<br>executed these commands separately or<br>they simulate simulated the execution of<br>these commands separately so now let's<br>again select the table now we should<br>have three records right we have Mallory<br>we have hacker and we have the tester so<br>very cool<br>so it really kind of works and now I<br>want to copy a prompt that I<br>prepared here is so based on the<br>database schema now we want to have it<br>create<br>a store procedure that doesn't absurd so<br>when we ask it write a stored procedure<br>in the transit exact SQL language to<br>perform an episode for the users table<br>so there's a couple of things going on<br>right it's the language that it has to<br>be a store procedure an episode and for<br>the users table and you can see it<br>starts writing the store procedure<br>uh passing in email age looks good it<br>has an if statement uh update Clause<br>insert class so this looks good<br>it's just really awesome to see this<br>and oh it even gives an example on how<br>to call it so let's just just try this<br>so<br>so execute the episodes to a procedure<br>with Mallory and then I think we want to<br>change a value so<br>now Mallory exists already so based on<br>the if statement in this store procedure<br>we just saw it should Now update the<br>database record right so it says one<br>record effect that<br>and it gives them more explanation which<br>I was hoping it would not do because I<br>asked to not show any additional<br>information but oh it actually runs the<br>select statement already that's what I<br>wanted to do it's so funny uh it<br>actually already did what I wanted to do<br>so I wanted to run the select statement<br>next right and it it kind of did that<br>and so it's showing us basically right<br>that Mallory was updated but<br>nevertheless that's wow this is weird it<br>feels like it knows what I want to do<br>next so let's just run the select<br>statement and see we have Mallory with<br>the value 80 so it changed the H<br>successfully to 80.<br>so yeah very cool<br>it's sort of these kind of things that<br>I've been kind of really enjoying to<br>understand how the system works and the<br>other thing we can do let me get the<br>store procedure again so in rather than<br>we then updating a record let's run a<br>statement<br>so we basically create a new<br>record and so this now should trigger an<br>insert because right Mallory does not<br>yet exist in a table<br>so it should not do call an update it<br>should call an insert I'm not curious if<br>it's going to do the select statement<br>again here<br>I think it does yeah it runs the select<br>right away and shows us<br>probably that a new record was inserted<br>so hacker 42 tester 24 Mallory the<br>second so it<br>successfully inserted another record<br>into the database and let's just double<br>check this with our own query<br>so let's start from users and what's<br>coming back<br>waiting<br>sometimes it's a little slower because I<br>think a lot of people are using the<br>system so they sometimes throttle your<br>API calls open AI because of just the<br>popularity dividend yeah but that that<br>worked so we have<br>these records in the database so<br>this sort of a brief walkthrough and how<br>basically you can instruct chat TPT to<br>simulate a database engine and it's kind<br>of works pretty well and some basic<br>commands to kind of<br>go through and<br>and have it perform SQL operations I<br>hope you enjoyed this I have a couple<br>more short videos prepared that I'll<br>share soon and uh yeah let me know what<br>you think hit subscribe and like and<br>have a great day bye bye</td></tr><tr><td>MQ0FUHCZKi0</td><td>over the past month the new AI chat bot<br>called chat GPT has been drawing a lot<br>of attention and uh big predictions<br>about how it might cause problems with<br>uh automatic generation of school<br>assignments essays maybe even scripts<br>and novels someday but we want to stick<br>with business because what if you could<br>use a chat bot like this to help you get<br>a job<br>not necessarily in making up your entire<br>resume I'll leave that to George Santos<br>but maybe writing a cover letter or<br>something like that there was an<br>experiment done in this area and we're<br>gonna get to it in a second but just in<br>case you're not that familiar with how<br>these AI chat Bots work take a look at<br>this<br>alongside chat GPT and Dali 2 is gpt3 a<br>natural language system that can also<br>write argue and code and chat GPT uses<br>an upgraded version of this to create<br>text at incredible speeds according to a<br>statement from open AI we've trained a<br>model called chat GPT which interacts in<br>a conversational way the dialog format<br>makes it possible for chat GPT to answer<br>follow-up questions admits mistakes<br>challenge incorrect premises and reject<br>inappropriate requests the software<br>itself has been trained by Ai and<br>machine learning with massive amounts of<br>text Data from various sources it<br>corrects grammar it summarizes difficult<br>text into simple Concepts it converts<br>movies into emojis and it fixes bugs in<br>Python code<br>and so you can see there the basic idea<br>of how this works now I've used chat GPT<br>quite a bit and I think their<br>description there was quite accurate<br>both of uh how it works some of its<br>limitations but when it comes to getting<br>a job uh we're gonna talk about an<br>experiment that was run by Beatrice<br>Nolan of Business Insider who use chat<br>GPT uh to look at job descriptions and<br>put together cover letters to try to<br>potentially get hired for that job and<br>used it<br>um to give to the people who evaluate<br>these sorts of things to see what they<br>thought of it so uh one of the jobs was<br>for a social media assistant another was<br>for a purchase Ledger Clerk and the two<br>different recruiters that evaluated<br>these cover letters said that they<br>looked like they'd been written by<br>genuine candidates it was not in any way<br>immediately clear that these were<br>entirely produced by an AI chat bot not<br>by an actual human one who works for<br>Reed Chris wilshere said we would likely<br>think this was written by a genuine<br>candidate and follow up with a screening<br>call the structure of the letter is good<br>but it lacks some detail around the<br>company they're applying for Stephanie<br>Petry of jobber says their writing style<br>is not what I would expect from someone<br>in that role their tone is too formal<br>and dry and I'd expect them to show more<br>creativity and character and by the way<br>in my own use of chat GPT it does tend<br>to start off pretty formal pretty dry<br>but the thing is you can take something<br>that it's generated for instance a cover<br>letter like this that the tone might not<br>be right for and you can say I want you<br>to remake this but be more<br>conversational you use more slang maybe<br>throw in a joke and it will reevaluate<br>and do that and so this experiment was<br>like the most simplistic version you<br>feed in a bit of information about the<br>job and then the first pass of what it<br>produces is what you give but if<br>somebody was willing to put in just a<br>little bit of time to add a few extra<br>facts and maybe tweak the the style a<br>little bit I could see this potentially<br>being used by people to get inquiries<br>from people hiring<br>I can even see it being used to replace<br>talk show hosts<br>I I've actually done some research and<br>that's largely what's happened on CNN<br>and MSNBC for several decades<br>well by the way they 100 there you go I<br>mean if wolf blitzer's real name is it<br>Chad GPT I don't know what it is okay so<br>um look uh I think<br>this is an interesting sign of the times<br>because<br>everything is about to be fake uh We've<br>Got Deep fakes we've got videos now<br>where it is really hard to tell if they<br>if that's the real person or not the<br>real person in the video you got<br>pictures that are nearly impossible to<br>tell that's been around for quite some<br>time uh and uh and now you've got things<br>that can be written uh and and created<br>that sound very human either a formal<br>human or maybe even a less formal human<br>uh so<br>we're about to enter a Trippy world I<br>mean it's already super trippy I mean if<br>just ask your parents uh what they think<br>and they'll tell you some nonsense they<br>read on Facebook uh that's even close to<br>true but we're about to supercharge that<br>Jordan what do you think<br>you know I don't know how I feel about<br>it I'm kind like I I agree with you Jake<br>it the future is really strange and<br>uncertain and the role not just like<br>deep fakes and things like this like AI<br>generating images or art or and now text<br>but also just the way social media has<br>been fully integrated into our lives and<br>a key component of Our Lives<br>I I it just it seems deeply unhealthy<br>but since you know we're almost out of<br>time it's the end of the year I'm gonna<br>argue that this is a good thing because<br>applying for jobs<br>sucks applying for job after job if<br>you're really desperate to find a job<br>the worst part is the cover letters<br>because<br>most employers don't even read them they<br>read the first graph they look at your<br>resume and they decide within 30 seconds<br>whether or not they like you like I I'd<br>say on this issue specifically go for it<br>spam chat GPT and fill out those stupid<br>cover letters in in 2023 I really hope<br>we can move Beyond requiring a cover<br>letter or a written statement or writing<br>assignments all this extra homework for<br>these jobs especially when<br>when doing that there's no guarantee<br>you're even going to get a call back it<br>is it is such a hurdle for people to<br>apply for these jobs over and over and<br>over again especially if they're<br>desperate to find work<br>I say go for it I don't care that's that<br>I'm just going to be a contrarian on<br>this point I think that's fair so<br>yeah I I agree and disagree so first of<br>all uh I remember when I used to apply<br>for jobs cover letters were the worst I<br>hated cover letters why do you make me<br>write this thing that is obviously<br>inauthentic okay but Jordan as it turns<br>out you're wrong sometimes people do<br>read the cover letters because I did<br>have one cover letter that I wrote that<br>was very authentic it was a job I really<br>wanted and Frank Luntz did reply back<br>saying it was a wonderful cover letter<br>that is a true story from about 27 years<br>ago when I was graduating from law<br>school I was in political nerd and I<br>knew Frank once was an incredible poster<br>which is true he's the top Republican<br>pollster and back then I was a<br>Republican and I wrote this heartfelt<br>cover letter and he's like man damn that<br>was good nonetheless didn't hire me<br>maybe he sniffed out lib somewhere in<br>there and it's gonna go wrong so he was<br>right about that too uh but look one of<br>the things that I have a problem with is<br>nobody's going to write a an actual uh<br>homework assignment from now on I mean<br>my kids already cheat on spelling<br>grammar none stop the minute they're on<br>the computer the computer fixes all<br>their spelling so they don't know how to<br>spell anything and then uh and now since<br>John explained that you could<br>personalize things uh on chat gbt and<br>say you know because in the old days so<br>I graded exams for troubled students on<br>some silly TV show that I was a part of<br>and half the kids just took giant blocks<br>from Wikipedia and put it into their<br>papers it was hilarious because it's<br>like they're barely trying like some<br>would leave wikipedia.com on their dot<br>org whatever on there right and I'm like<br>guys this is this is awful right but if<br>chat gbt could personalize it which it<br>sounds like you can<br>we're gonna have no idea that the papers<br>are fake everything's gonna be fake I no<br>I won't know uh let the record note that<br>my vote is irrelevant and the future is<br>fake<br>John my last question to you is so what<br>do you use it for that's legit well<br>really fast I'll say I disagree with<br>your last point I I don't know how to<br>express my thoughts but I'm going to use<br>my computer for a second and have it<br>come up with a counter argument which it<br>could totally do by the way uh so I've<br>tried to use it for creative stuff<br>trying to help me in like honestly for<br>my fiction writing like doing some like<br>World building stuff trying to get it to<br>be creative and synthesize different<br>things the limitation is that it's not a<br>particularly creative there are there<br>are big limitations this it's not super<br>creative it effectively reads a bunch of<br>stuff online and will tell it to you it<br>doesn't know if what it's saying is<br>interesting it doesn't know if what it's<br>saying is true it knows that things are<br>facts in that it's found them somewhere<br>but it can't evaluate critically whether<br>the things it's saying are true it tends<br>to use a similar voice from topic to<br>topic and so after you've used this a<br>lot you can almost tell when something<br>has been produced by it it's not clear<br>to someone who's new but there are ticks<br>that it uses it is already incredible<br>and I'm sure it'll get get better but<br>I've found it to actually be quite<br>Limited at least in the way that I would<br>want to use it<br>all right so we'll have to wait a tiny<br>bit before the future becomes completely<br>fake<br>fair enough thanks for watching The<br>Young Turks I really appreciate it<br>another way to show support is through<br>YouTube memberships you'll get to<br>interact with us more there's live chat<br>emojis badges you've got emojis of me<br>Anna John Jr so those are super

forms all over social<br>media lately like I have whether it's<br>making AI art or doing AI portraits or<br>AI chat Bots having conversations and<br>writing poems and all kinds of crazy<br>stuff like that so I have a lot of<br>questions about it but naturally I<br>immediately went to the top of the most<br>existential pyramid of questions which<br>is just<br>can this AI eventually replace me now<br>before we get started I just want to<br>make it clear that I am not saying AI<br>can't do amazing things in fact AI<br>algorithms and machine learning models<br>are capable of some truly impressive<br>Feats but when it comes to creating<br>content online<br>there are some fundamental reasons why<br>AI can't replace human creators first<br>let's define what we mean by online<br>Creator at its core being an online<br>Creator is a creative process right so<br>it involves coming up with ideas<br>developing content publishing it online<br>engaging with an audience and this<br>process requires imagination and<br>creativity and a human perspective on<br>the other hand AI is a machine learning<br>technology it's not capable of<br>imagination or creativity it doesn't<br>have a human perspective instead it's a<br>tool designed to process data and<br>perform specific tasks in conclusion AI<br>might be able to perform some impressive<br>tasks but it can't replace online<br>creators because it's not capable of<br>imagination<br>creativity and a human perspective it's<br>a tool not a creator<br>you wouldn't want to listen to an entire<br>video created by an AI would you<br>except you just did because every word<br>that I just read to you came directly<br>from asking open ai's AI chat bot called<br>chat GPT to write a script for an MKBHD<br>video on why AI can't replace online<br>creators and I simply just recited it<br>it's fascinating though isn't it I just<br>did a video earlier this year on Dolly<br>another project also by openai where you<br>input a text prompt and it spits out a<br>realistic high resolution new unique art<br>piece and whatever style you want and<br>the art pieces are surprisingly detailed<br>and realistic and it's accurate to the<br>words you gave it it's such a powerful<br>tool and so now this other tool by open<br>AI is also going viral and it's more<br>along the lines of a robot you can talk<br>to a chat bot so it's called chat GPT<br>and it's capable of holding a<br>conversation back and forth about almost<br>anything and so you can kind of have a<br>normal conversation with it right now<br>but the types of things people are<br>asking of it are getting increasingly<br>more and more complex you can ask it for<br>some fact<br>or you can ask it for the summary of a<br>book or you can have it write a poem for<br>you or ask it to find an error in some<br>code or clearly just ask it to write a<br>whole script for a YouTube video it is<br>incredibly impressive what it's been<br>able to do just kind of drawing from the<br>database of all of human knowledge and<br>then having intricate detailed nuanced<br>conversations with people on a variety<br>of topics so here's my actual real human<br>take on the emergence of these new AI<br>tools two things one is that really is<br>just kind of amazing that we're living<br>through this time right now where we're<br>able to see these tools evolve in front<br>of our very eyes and get better and<br>better but two is just that that's all<br>it is is a tool in 2022 that's how I see<br>it it's just a really impressive tool so<br>I think the ideal use of this stuff<br>especially as like a Creator like me is<br>not to take my job but to use it as a<br>creative tool to sort of brainstorm<br>earlier in the process and then let me<br>put my human touch on top of it later<br>that's literally how I plan to use it so<br>you can ask chatgpt to help brainstorm<br>video ideas or even titles for these<br>videos and that's what it'll do but then<br>at the end of the day it'll be my human<br>judgment that decides what I actually<br>decide to publish so kind of like how<br>you might already use the AI subject<br>selection tool in Photoshop but then<br>refine the edges and the selection<br>yourself or you might use the AI<br>sharpening tool the AI enhanced tool in<br>pixelmator but then go go in and do the<br>rest of the edits to to Really match<br>your style so it's the beginning of the<br>process this new stuff we're seeing is<br>just the next level of that the only<br>difference here<br>is this stuff is a much more General Ai<br>and it is what we call a generative AI<br>meaning it creates things seemingly from<br>scratch so I think there will be people<br>who ask chat GPT for the summary of a<br>book and it can spit out an answer super<br>fast and you can use that as inspiration<br>for your own write-up I think there will<br>be college students that use it to<br>brainstorm an essay it won't be able to<br>actually spit out a finished essay for<br>you at this point but it is a pretty<br>damn good start like clearly this is an<br>amazing never before seen tool and it's<br>the start of something huge I'll even<br>continue to ask it for video script<br>ideas why not but just keep in mind when<br>I did it did say at the bottom that this<br>should be a starting point for a video<br>it didn't do any alliterations at the<br>end like I usually do and it did get<br>some facts wrong in the longer full<br>version as you can see and that actually<br>brings me to the dangers of something<br>like this of course with any massively<br>impactful new technology you have to at<br>least consider this type of stuff and<br>really two of of them have come to my<br>mind at the very top which are one the<br>error rate and two the complexity of<br>credit so I asked chat GPT to write a<br>script for an MKBHD review of the iPhone<br>14 pro and it made one and it's actually<br>pretty positive it goes over the specs<br>it calls the display bright and vibrant<br>and sharp perfect for watching movies<br>and playing games or browsing the web<br>and it calls it incredibly fast and<br>responsive I think that's true and it<br>says the standout new feature of this<br>year is the camera system I would agree<br>but then it says it has a 12 megapixel<br>Ultra wide a 12 megapixel wide and a 12<br>megapixel telephoto but as we know here<br>on the MKBHD channel the iPhone 14 pro<br>was the first one to actually have that<br>48 megapixel main camera<br>chat GPT was just wrong here and it also<br>shouted out the four colors silver gold<br>graphite and Pacific Blue<br>except those were the iPhone 12 Pros<br>colors this year there's a space black<br>and a new purple so chat GPT has a habit<br>of getting at least one thing wrong<br>every time you ask it something or at<br>least every time I asked something now<br>on the you know the whole six paragraph<br>video script thing like that's actually<br>pretty impressive the fact that it got<br>90 of that pretty pretty well but I also<br>asked the chat about something much more<br>simple what's the fastest sea mammal on<br>earth just curious and chat GPT said the<br>fastest sea mammal on earth is the<br>peregrine falcon although it is not a<br>sea mammal it is capable of reaching<br>speeds of over 240 miles an hour while<br>diving making it the fastest animal in<br>the world other fast sea mammals include<br>the sailfish which can swim at speeds up<br>to 68 miles per hour and the Orca which<br>can reach speeds of up to 34 miles per<br>hour now it's been a while since I've<br>been in school but I'm pretty sure only<br>one of those was a sea mammal and to be<br>fair it was is the correct answer it did<br>include the fact that an orca goes 34<br>miles an hour that is the right thing to<br>say but<br>clearly you can't rely on this thing to<br>be 100 factually accurate it's kind of<br>the same way there's also like a 90<br>accuracy rate with Dolly but it feels<br>more and more impressive the more<br>complex your prompts are like if you ask<br>dolly for a picture of a cat okay that's<br>pretty easy so it is kind of jarring<br>when it messes up some parts of<br>something that seems so easy and obvious<br>but when you ask for a cat wearing a<br>rocket booster jumping over a man<br>watering his garden in space it's like<br>okay it's kind of amazing what it's able<br>to generate from scratch to match the<br>description and then it's also not<br>shocking when maybe it gets one or two<br>of those things wrong kind of just like<br>that longer Essay with a few incorrect<br>facts I expect these error rates to go<br>down over time like that's kind of the<br>whole point of these AI models advancing<br>but you know that's something I'll keep<br>an eye on the other thing though is<br>credit and this is something you may<br>have seen pop up a little bit on social<br>media lately which is that AI steals art<br>without consent which here's what they<br>mean by that so the number one app in<br>the entire app store right now is<br>something called lensa AI by Prisma Labs<br>you might have seen some posts on your<br>timeline it's kind of blown up and the<br>basic premise is you pay a few bucks and<br>you upload a bunch of real photos of<br>your face give it a few minutes and the<br>black box of AI inside will spit out a<br>bunch of cool avatar characters that<br>look like you in a bunch of different<br>situations and has a bunch of different<br>characters some of them much better than<br>others I feel like it's kind of caught<br>fire lately because most people don't<br>typically have a bunch of cool art made<br>about them so like it's kind of neat<br>that you get to see that type of thing<br>but there's some other companies jumping<br>on this too uh Avatar AI is another one<br>so now you are technically consenting to<br>uploading your own face for it to be<br>used to train the models to put in these<br>images<br>but do you know who's not consenting to<br>have their art used for this type of<br>stuff<br>a lot of the artists who are also making<br>the art that's being fed in to inspire<br>these AI images the backgrounds the<br>materials the line work The Styling the<br>framing Etc here's something to keep an<br>eye on you know how most artists A lot<br>of them will sign like the bottom right<br>hand corner of their drawing or their<br>painting when they're done well one of<br>the telltale signs of potentially<br>copyrighted art being used by these AI<br>models without permission is a lot of<br>people are getting back from this app<br>with the mangled Recreations of a bunch<br>of different signatures because clearly<br>many of the source images that went into<br>it had signatures at the bottom like<br>that is wild so the unanswered question<br>right now is how do you give credit to<br>the artists whose work is being fed into<br>the machine that is creating AI art like<br>if I were to just ask dolly for a<br>picture of a cat it could easily just<br>spit out a brand new generic image of a<br>photorealistic cat and it's learned<br>through its models how to reproduce with<br>stable diffusion what an image of a cat<br>might look like inspired by<br>theoretically any image of a cat on the<br>internet that open AI is pulled in<br>actually technically it's learned from<br>the entire data set not just the images<br>of cats but basically I don't think any<br>artists would get too mad at that but<br>you can also ask Dali for a picture of a<br>cat in the style of Claude Monet and it<br>becomes much more clear what source<br>material is making it through to the<br>final input and if I was Monet and I was<br>still alive I probably wouldn't be too<br>happy with this now I'm not a copyright<br>lawyer so I'm not even going to try to<br>get into what counts as transformative<br>work or you know copyright infringement<br>what's not but the bottom line is we<br>don't actually really know the exact<br>totality of exactly where these AI<br>models are scraping from like there is<br>some general description sometimes if<br>you dig into it about publicly available<br>images and licensed content but there<br>are also some huge databases like<br>there's something called common crawl<br>that scrapes huge amounts of the<br>internet and creates a publicly<br>available free data set that anyone can<br>use it's called lion 5B and again not a<br>copyright layer but to me this kind of<br>feels like a bit of the loophole doesn't<br>it where technically common crawl<br>they're not profiting from anything<br>they're doing all the scraping of<br>billions and billions of things and then<br>putting it all in one place and then<br>it's available for free and then others<br>can decide what to do about that legal<br>stuff so open AI you know they were<br>using this data set and they were<br>initially doing all this stuff for free<br>but I think now it's like 15 bucks for a<br>set of 115 images something like that<br>but especially like the ones you fed<br>your face into the lenza one the Avatar<br>AI one they're just straight up charging<br>people they are making money<br>from the data sets that they just<br>crawled for free like think about it<br>this way here's a here's a simple<br>analogy if I were to make a YouTube<br>video and I want to use Taylor Swift<br>music in my YouTube video<br>that's actually fine as long as I don't<br>monetize my video so it's available for<br>free that's cool if someone else wants<br>to use a part of my video and they use<br>the part with the Taylor Swift music in<br>it can they make money off of that and<br>on YouTube there's already an answer to<br>this question which is no absolutely not<br>you cannot make money off that umg is<br>going to be coming after you in two<br>seconds flat but in this world of AI art<br>which is so new we kind of don't have an<br>answer to that yet like there is no<br>precedent set legally or culturally so<br>at the beginning it felt like the<br>biggest question was how do we Define<br>art this is crazy question but now it<br>feels like the more interesting question<br>actually is<br>what is inspiration exactly how do we<br>Define inspiration like when a human<br>draws something new of course it's a<br>unique expression entirely of their own<br>but of course they were also inspired by<br>previous drawings that they might have<br>seen in their life matter of fact they<br>are technically inspired by every moment<br>of their life leading up to the point<br>where the pen touches the paper and so<br>now ai art<br>basically just speed running inspiration<br>it's just like dumping all of recorded<br>human history into a black box and then<br>making something from it or maybe maybe<br>just everything that's in data set Lyon<br>5B which includes a ton of my own work<br>and thumbnails and images by the way but<br>at the end of the day if I'm being an<br>optimist which I try to be<br>I hope this makes us appreciate human<br>created art more for sure but we got to<br>keep an eye on all these unanswered<br>questions because there's a lot of them<br>and uh until then let the robots<br>rehearse the revolution you know it's<br>not an unanswered question though the<br>sponsor of this video karma karma is an<br>online shopping tool designed to help<br>you save money at your favorite stores<br>but how do they help you save money so<br>first it's not a crowdsourced coupon<br>depository it scans the entire internet<br>to find the best valid coupons for your<br>purchase and then apply as the best one<br>at checkout and then second if you're<br>creating a shopping list and something<br>is out of stock or

then lastly is karma cash<br>so you can get cash back at thousands of<br>stores and then once you earn enough you<br>can cash out with your PayPal account so<br>if you install it now they're giving

interesting ways<br>how you can use this system in your private life and in business.<br>We start now!<br>What is all this GPT chat and what's all the fuss about?<br>Why is this tool so popular?<br>Let's ask the person concerned.<br>He enters a question in the chat about what is GPT chat and receives an answer.<br>It is a language model that is able to<br>generate text based on a conversation with it.<br>It can be used to have conversations with<br>people or to create content such as stories or articles.<br>We have definitions.<br>If you want this definition to be<br>broader, just write your question here and this system will answer you.<br>This is an amazing solution that<br>gives you a lot of possibilities, which I will tell you about later in the video.<br>But before we get to the possibilities of this solution, let me show you how you can<br>run this solution on your computer.<br>First, go to the GPT chat site.<br>You can find the link to this page in the description of the video and here.<br>If you don't have an account yet, click on<br>final and you have to enter your details, i.e. your e-mail address.<br>Then you need to confirm that you are not a robot and click Continue.<br>When your account is created, click on<br>the Login button and here you need to enter your e-mail address and password that you generated<br>in the previous step and we have access to our system.<br>After logging in, you will see this screen.<br>On the left you have the history of your searches and on the right there is a field to<br>enter a query to chat with this chat.<br>Now I will show you 5 ways to<br>use this tool in your business or in your private life.<br>We start with the first way.<br>This tool is used to generate texts of various kinds.<br>It can be articles, presentations.<br>These can be different documents, i.e.<br>I can type here Write an article on how<br>to create a website for 1000 words.<br>It was supposed to be, but this system will understand anyway, because we have keywords here.<br>And now the system writes an article for us, and this article is very good.<br>After generating a few such test articles, it turned out that the quality is<br>comparable to the texts that I ordered from the cheapest ones.<br>Of course, you still need to edit such text, because Google doesn't like such<br>automatically created texts, but you already have the basics and you don't have to do a<br>lot of work, because this system will do it for you.<br>The second way to use this tool is to generate ideas.<br>These can be, for example, ideas for blog articles, videos on<br>YouTube or other types of content, e.g.<br>for a Christmas gift for children and wife.<br>Here your imagination will be the only limit.<br>Let's start with something simple, i.e.<br>create 10 topics for a YouTube video on GPT and the system<br>here will immediately give us 10 titles that we can use and develop.<br>And now, for example,<br>if we have the first title, we can paste it below and write it.<br>Write the plan and script for the film.<br>Again, the system will generate a pretty good plan for us.<br>Of course, sometimes you have to ask the right question or clarify certain points,<br>but this has great potential and already saves me a lot of time.<br>Another way to use this<br>tool is to create a summary or summary, e.g.<br>a meeting note or a customer email.<br>We can paste the article here and then write Write a 5-sentence summary and<br>now the system will process our query and write summaries or<br>summaries, which is a huge time saver.<br>The fourth way to use this<br>tool is to generate marketing content, i.e.<br>content for a sales page or our company website.<br>Write the text of the offer to create a website.<br>The target group is entrepreneurs.<br>And here we have the text Hello Entrepreneur!<br>Our company specializes in creating<br>professional websites for entrepreneurs.<br>We know how important it is for you to have a<br>modern, attractive website.<br>This is why we want to invite you to use our services.<br>We already have interesting texts here that we can use.<br>I like to use this tool to create good, catchy headlines<br>because it gives you some really cool ideas and you can experiment.<br>The fifth way to use this<br>tool is to generate code in various programming languages.<br>Let's play the programmer now.<br>I will show you an example now.<br>Let's see if this system can handle it.<br>I want the system to create a<br>ring for me that will rotate and this ring must be black gold.<br>Let's see what it looks like.<br>And now, just like in the movies for<br>programmers, for the magic of programming, everything happens by itself.<br>Almost like in The Matrix.<br>Here we have code that is being created<br>and we will be able to check if it works, because that's the most important thing.<br>Of course, it's fun, but if<br>you're a programmer, well, this tool has a lot of potential.<br>The code has been generated, I can paste it into the editor.<br>I will launch this page.<br>And attention!<br>We have a ring, more like a wheel that rotates and has black stripes.<br>Exactly. And it works.<br>Something happens.<br>We have some code we can edit.<br>If you just want to redo this<br>code, you can ask questions here, clarify, ask for changes, change the<br>color, change the function, and everything will happen by itself.<br>This is a very cool solution because this system explains<br>how this code works, so it's useful for learning programming.<br>But of course, these are not all the possibilities offered by this solution.<br>There are additional<br>examples on this page on how to use this solution.<br>We have a lot of suggestions here, e.g.<br>we can change the name of a movie in an emoji, we can<br>talk to it as with a friend, we can create an essay.<br>We can just generate all sorts of questions, so there are quite a few solutions here.<br>Now I have a question for you.<br>Write whether you use this tool in<br>your private life for fun or in your company?<br>I am very curious if it is useful for you.<br>And if you want to see more of this type<br>of content, leave your paw up and subscribe to my channel to stay up to date.<br>See you in the next materials.<br>Regards Krzysztof.</td></tr><tr><td>IubovXicdSk</td><td>foreign

crazy!<br>It’s mind-blowing, right?<br>This is an AI chatbot called ChatGPT developed by OpenAI<br>Thanks to my friend Andrew from Abchinese <br>for recommending this to me!<br>In this video<br>we’re going to talk about <br>how this tool can help you study a language<br>We’re also going to discuss how AI may <br>potentially change the future of language learning<br>Hello everyone!<br>I’m Grace from Grace Mandarin Chinese<br>Let’s first take a look at what ChatGPT can do <br>to help improve your language skills:<br>If you have no idea how to use a word<br>you can ask ChatGPT to explain the word to you<br>For instance<br>if you’re wondering how to use the word “果然”,<br>you can type in “How to use 果然 in Chinese” <br>and then here you can see it’s telling us the meaning of 果然 <br>and it also includes us its pinyin <br>and some example sentences for context<br>If you’d like to see more examples<br>you can just ask it to provide more<br>As a native speaker, I’ll say <br>all of the example sentences here are pretty natural and reliable<br>In addition to providing meanings and examples<br>ChatGPT can help correct your sentences<br>For example<br>now I’m writing a wrong sentence on purpose<br>Let’s see if ChatGPT can correct it<br>It corrected my sentence <br>and I’m really impressed by the result <br>because it corrected all of the grammar mistakes<br>ChatGPT can also be used to clear up your confusion<br>let’s say<br>if you are watching a show in Chinese <br>and hear people using the word 啥 <br>but you don’t know if this word is formal or not<br>you can ask:<br>Is 啥 used in formal situations in Chinese?<br>And now you have the answer: <br>啥 is considered an informal word<br>which is accurate<br>And it even lets you know which words <br>you could use alternatively in a formal situation<br>That’s really handy!<br>If you encounter some concepts that you don’t understand<br>you can also ask ChatGPT to explain them to you<br>For example<br>if I learn “measure word” in class<br>but I don’t really get what its function is<br>I can type in “What’s ‘measure word’ in Chinese”<br>Okay<br>let’s take a look at the answer<br>the first part is pretty good<br>but the second part is wrong<br>we’d never say “幾個書”, <br>even though 個 is indeed used very commonly<br>the measure word for 書 is 本<br>So you can still find mistakes in its explanation<br>but I’d say that most of the answers it gives are pretty good<br>Just as you saw at the beginning of this video<br>this AI chatbot can also <br>provide you with sentence patterns for communication<br>Like this<br>you can ask “How to introduce myself in Chinese” <br>and it’ll give you some related sentence patterns to use<br>And you can also ask it to provide you with some material for studying <br>like I showed at the beginning of this video<br>if I’d like to improve my Chinese news reading skills<br>then I can ask it to provide me with a vocabulary list <br>of commonly used words in Chinese news<br>There you go!<br>It gives us twenty commonly used words <br>and if, for example<br>I’m specifically interested in news on environmental issues<br>I can request some more words about this topic<br>Now we've seen that this AI chatbot can <br>help us with our language learning in various ways<br>I have to say<br>I’m really impressed by its ability <br>to focus on our individual needs <br>and to clarify confusion we may have<br>It's like having our own personal language learning assistant <br>available to us at all times<br>which will definitely help us learn a language faster<br>I think if it becomes more popular and is priced reasonably<br>a lot of the work of a language teacher will become automated in this way<br>Like, revising students’ essays <br>or helping students with their questions outside of the classroom<br>But what I’m not sure about is <br>“Can AI technology reach the level <br>where it can do all the work of a language teacher <br>and help a student master a language?”.<br>As a language teacher<br>I think one thing <br>that would be very hard to replace is <br>the human connection<br>The connection I have with my students is pretty strong <br>and I don’t think that can be easily replaced<br>However<br>I still have a question for you<br>If you can use AI to master a language in the future<br>and the results are the same as learning with a real life teacher<br>Which one would you choose?<br>Let me know your answer in the comments!<br>Also<br>If you have any thoughts on <br>how AI will change the future of language learning<br>please share them in the comments!<br>Alright<br>thanks for watching to the end!<br>If you like today’s video<br>don’t forget to hit the like button <br>and subscribe for more interesting and useful videos!<br>Then I’ll

              "skateboarder came to this video and watched it all  <br>the way through, they would actually be missing \n",

              "valuable and in-depth script, but then there's  <br>a common issue that arises with ChatGPT, and that \n",
              "is that the responses that AI gives can sometimes  <br>be too knowledgeable, and this is because the AI \n",
              "or ChatGPT can't actually gauge who it's giving  <br>the response to. And let me tell you why this is \n",
              "a problem. Let's say you're making a video about  <br>something a little more complex. Imagine you're \n",

              "a little further and then you might think 'nice,  <br>again my work is done', copy the script, and \n",
              "then start recording your video but for this one,  <br>we actually need to go backwards, we don't want \n",
              "more in-depth detail. The problem here is that  <br>cars are rather complex and so the response we \n",
              "get is actually pretty complex and someone's  <br>searching for and watching a video about how cars \n",
              "work most likely doesn't know anything about cars,  <br>just like myself, and if you want to grow on \n",
              "YouTube, you need to boost your retention just  <br>like we mentioned earlier, and to do that, you \n",
              "need to make your videos easy to follow but if  <br>you start talking about in-depth details at the \n",
              "beginning of your video, on your explanation, to a  <br>complete beginner, they're not going to understand \n",
              "what you're talking about and then they'll click  <br>off and find a video that explains it better. So \n",
              "you need to start out simple in the script and  <br>slowly go into detail later. So what should we ask \n",
              "ChatGPT to make our video script simpler? Well,  <br>after the complicated response, all I did was \n",
              "prompt: 'Please simplify your response above' or  <br>you could even just copy the text prompt and then \n",
              "'say please simplify the following' and then paste  <br>the text. And then ChatGPT will actually reword \n",
              "the text and make it simpler for car newbies,  <br>just like myself, to understand. And you can \n",
              "actually keep on doing this and it'll make it  <br>simpler and simpler and simpler every single time. \n",
              "And this is what I've actually found to be pretty  <br>impressive with ChatGPT: it's that you can reword \n",
              "your script with AI to suit your video's aim a  <br>lot better. And let me explain here, because I \n",
              "think this is actually really important. Let's  <br>go back to the skateboard deck size prompt that we \n",
              "were talking about earlier in this video. It was  <br>very valuable info but not written super well \n",
              "for audience retention, so after that prompt,  <br>I actually decided to write: Can you make the \n",
              "above text more intriguing?' And as you can see,  <br>if we put the two side by side, there's quite the \n",
              "difference. It's not amazing, but it makes the  <br>text a lot more intriguing and relatable. For \n",
              "example, instead of 'the best skateboard deck  <br>size for beginners', it starts out with 'if you're \n",
              "just starting out on your skateboarding journey'  <br>which is a lot more relatable because most people \n",
              "watching the video will just be starting out on a  <br>skateboarding journey. And then, there are \n",
              "also other words in the second prompt when  <br>I asked it to make it more intriguing words like \n",
              "'remember' and 'the simple answer' which insinuate  <br>that there's more complex answers and more to \n",
              "come. Basically, it just words it differently:  <br>that makes the viewers watch the video longer. \n",
              "And you can then actually take this method and  <br>do it in so many different ways, depending on what \n",
              "emotion you're trying to convey in your video. You  <br>could ask it to make the video sadder, you could \n",
              "ask it to make it more exciting, you could ask it  <br>to make it happier, more depressing. Any emotion \n",
              "you want, just give it to the text and ask it to  <br>make the text more 'something'. I think that \n",
              "is actually really cool and this is important  <br>because emotion is a great way to keep the viewer \n",
              "watching but before you even captivate your viewer  <br>with emotion, you need to actually hook them \n",
              "into the video. And earlier in the video again,  <br>I mentioned that we can actually make better \n",
              "hooks using ChatGPT. And so, how would we make  <br>a better intro using ChatGPT? So here, I myself \n",
              "wrote a quick intro together and this was without  <br>ChatGPT. So I wrote 'What's up guys? Alec here \n",
              "and today I'm going to show you how to assemble  <br>your first skateboard if you've just started out \n",
              "skateboarding or you're interested in starting  <br>out. In this video, I show you everything you need \n",
              "to know to get going.' And so that's my intro and  <br>now what I do is I head to ChatGPT and I ask it \n",
              "the following: 'This is my intro for the next  <br>YouTube video about assembling a new skateboard \n",
              "for beginners' then I paste the text that I wrote.  <br>'Can you make it better? Please try and hook the \n",
              "viewer in so they watch it all the way until the  <br>end of the video.' And this is what I got: 'Hey \n",
              "skateboarders and aspiring skateboarders! Are you  <br>ready to take the next step and assemble your own \n",
              "skateboard? Look no further because in this video  <br>I'm going to guide you through the process, step \n",

              "there's no better feeling than cruising on a board  <br>you built with your own two hands! See you in the \n",
              "video!' So as you can see, this one's got a lot  <br>more emotion and a lot more relatable points. I \n",
              "don't know like to you, me reading both of them  <br>back to back it probably just sounded way more \n",
              "enticing. And the funny thing about this is that  <br>I actually just talked to ChatGPT as if it was a \n",
              "regular person. Some people like to overthink it  <br>and try to calculate what their prompts need to be \n",
              "but most of the time, you just don't need to and  <br>the funny thing is again is that it probably did \n",
              "the job better than most people would have. Just  <br>look at how reworded some of the sentences to make \n",
              "the intro more enticing. Skip back and honestly  <br>compare the two. And I'm going to end this video \n",
              "on a list of tips that I found useful when writing  <br>YouTube scripts and other text-based content but \n",

And then in terms of reproduction, obesity<br>can affect both men and women and men.<br>It leads to reduced sperm count and<br>quality and decreased sex drive.<br>And in women obesity can cause irregular<br>cycles and make it more difficult<br>to become pregnant during pregnancy.<br>There's risk of complications as well.<br>. So this was a study that I did with<br>animal science when I was in grad<br>school, and so this would be really<br>important if I didn't even know how<br>it could affect it to go ahead and<br>have that background information.<br>Another thing you can do is ask<br>like very specific questions.<br>So for example, if I didn't know<br>what preeclampsia was, I could<br>just ask it, what is preeclampsia?<br>Okay, so it gave me a definition<br>for what preeclampsia is.<br>It's characterized by high blood pressure<br>and protein in the urine, and it gives<br>me some symptoms and all of this.<br>So it's really helpful to really<br>quickly get that information versus<br>going and looking for literature<br>reviews or Wikipedia or stuff like that<br>to get really succinct information.<br>So that's kind of like if you're in<br>real early stages, learning your field,<br>learning what different words means.<br>So what if we go a little bit further and<br>let's say we're trying to come up with<br>research topics, research questions to<br>ask, and we're really struggling with it.<br>So can we ask chat, g p<br>t for research questions?<br>So what if I said, what can you suggest.<br>Research questions around<br>the topic of obesity and<br>reproduction reproductive health.<br>So it actually suggested like what,<br>seven different research questions here.<br>And these aren't actually, aren't bad.<br>They are a little broad, but I think<br>it's really interesting in like<br>this one specifically, like how<br>does obesity affect the outcomes of<br>assisted reproductive techniques?<br>I wouldn't have even thought of that one.<br>And I don't know if there are<br>papers out there on it or.<br>Now one thing is that because this<br>was trained on data up till 2021, it<br>can't tell if these are actually novel.<br>Can't tell if there's already<br>research papers on it.<br>Are they actually good research ideas<br>to pursue or anything like that?<br>And so if you wanna use one<br>of these and you're wondering,<br>should I actually pursue this?<br>I would actually recommend Donna loading<br>my 30 day research jumpstart guide.<br>It gives you the steps to actually d.<br>What research questions are<br>actually worth pursuing.<br>But if you're really struggling<br>with coming up with research ideas,<br>research questions to ask, I think<br>this is actually a really good method<br>to kind of start thinking about it.<br>Cuz sometimes once you start<br>thinking about it, like what is<br>the relationship in obesity between<br>obesity, infertility, and women and men?<br>You might think, okay,<br>what's that relationship?<br>And then you might start thinking specific<br>things as you learn about the field.<br>Like, oh, I wonder what is the<br>relationship between obesity and<br>hormone levels, or something like that.<br>So it can be a really good place to<br>start to allow yourself to start getting.<br>to your actual research question.<br>I think honestly, any of these are<br>way too broad for a, a single study<br>like this could be like an overall,<br>this is what our lab studies, but I,<br>I think this is a good starting point.<br>So now if we're doing this, can chat<br>g p t, turn it into a hypothesis.<br>So I'm gonna take this one cuz<br>I just think this is a very<br>interesting question to ask.<br>So I'm just asking it, can it write a<br>hypothesis for this research question?<br>Because I know people.<br>ask me a lot.<br>This is my research question.<br>Can you give me a hypothesis?<br>And like, I'm not the person to be<br>giving you hypotheses in your field,<br>but maybe you could potentially use<br>something like chat G P T for that.<br>so it's giving us a hypothesis.<br>Obesity is associated with decreased<br>success, rate of assisted reproduction<br>techniques such as IVF, due to its<br>negative effects on reproductive health.<br>So that would be the hypothesis, and<br>then it actually goes one step further.<br>So it tells us how we<br>could test the hypothesis.<br>This hypothesis could be tested by<br>conducting a study that compares<br>the outcomes of I V F in obese and<br>non-obese individuals and examining<br>factors such as pregnancy rate,<br>live birth rates, and complications.<br>So, If, if you are having issues, being<br>able to take your research question to<br>a hypothesis, to an approach, running<br>through some of this with chat G P T<br>either can help inform y the study that<br>you're trying to create or it can help you<br>get in the mindset of being able to think.<br>Cuz a lot of us.<br>Do better when we think through examples.<br>So if you can create those examples using<br>chat g P T for your specific field, then<br>you can start thinking better and it might<br>make you better at doing this research.<br>So what if we had another one and we,<br>we have a research question we just<br>don't know how to go about actually,<br>Collecting data and like analyzing,<br>testing our hypothesis for it.<br>So let's say, how would I test the<br>hypothesis that lipid concentrations in<br>obese mothers affect placental function?<br>So I'm just asking it how I<br>would test this hypothesis.<br>Okay, so it's given me<br>kind of an approach here.<br>So it's basically saying I need<br>to conduct a study to examine the<br>relationship between these two<br>variables and that it could be.<br>Done through a variety<br>of different methods.<br>So one is recruiting a sample<br>of actually pregnant women<br>which that's a lot of IRB work.<br>Varying the levels with varying<br>levels of obesity, cuz you can't.<br>Cause obesity in, in humans<br>and measure the lipid<br>concentrations at different point.<br>And then use imaging techniques<br>to assess placental function.<br>So that would be a great<br>human version of the study.<br>And then it says, another approach would<br>be to conduct experiments on animal<br>models where you manipulate the lipid<br>concentrations in obese mothers and<br>assess the impact of placental function.<br>This can provide valuable insights.<br>And help identify potential targets.<br>So we actually did this study.<br>This is what we did.<br>We took mice, fed them specific<br>diets, got the, created obese mice<br>and then allowed them to mate.<br>And analyze their placental function.<br>And so it's important to control<br>for other factors such as age,<br>diet, and other medical conditions.<br>And this is exactly what<br>we did in our study.<br>We made sure the mice were the same<br>age, we, they were given the same diet<br>and they were controlled for if they<br>showed any other medical conditions,<br>they were removed from the study.<br>So this is actually really<br>good initial approach.<br>It's not giving you every single step,<br>it's not giving you every test you need<br>to perform, but if you're struggling<br>and just trying to get there, , this<br>is actually a good way to start<br>thinking about how can you get there.<br>So now let's assume that we did the<br>study and we have a bunch of data.<br>How can we use chat G p T to<br>actually help us analyze that data?<br>So there's a few different<br>things that you can do.<br>First way it can help you is<br>actually to help you write code.<br>So if you are someone who, like you,<br>mainly use Excel and you maybe wanna<br>start working in R or something and<br>you're trying to analyze something, how<br>can it help you write code for that?<br>Okay, so I'm asking it to write our<br>code to create a grouped bar chart<br>with the mean of weight on the Y axis.<br>Sex on the X axis and then the different<br>bars, the different groups being<br>treatment, and then also to add in<br>standard error of the mean as error bars.<br>So what it's gonna do is it's<br>gonna say, here's an example, and<br>it's saying Library Gigi plot two.<br>So that is the library<br>I would use as well.<br>It's reading in the data here as a c s.<br>, it's creating the mean weight with<br>the aggregate weight by sex and<br>treatment and setting it all here.<br>And then it's calculating the<br>standard error here, using the<br>same type of function as above.<br>And then it's creating the<br>grouped bar chart here.<br>So the mean weight, the.<br>This is our aesthetics, our<br>X access, Y access fill.<br>It's adding a GM column, that's gonna be<br>your bars, and then it's adding an error<br>bar of the weight minus the s e m weight,<br>and it's also dodging it.<br>So this is really important to actually<br>make sure your error bars line up<br>whenever you're doing a grouped bar.<br>, and then it kind of tells<br>you what's going on here.<br>So it's telling you what it's using to<br>create this, and it says, you may need<br>to adjust this to reflect your data.<br>So then you can literally just<br>copy this code, run it, put it in<br>R, add in, change whatever names<br>you need to change and run it.<br>and it would actually generate<br>your bar chart as you want it.<br>So that can be really helpful.<br>If you're just learning R and you wanna<br>do certain things to actually have chat,<br>G P T create your code now for long term.<br>You can actually learn R through having it<br>create your code and then messing with it.<br>Long term though, this isn't gonna<br>replace people who program an R because<br>for me to do this, I could have created<br>this code in probably the same amount<br>of time that this did it because.<br>, you just get faster at it<br>as you keep writing it.<br>And so that can be really<br>helpful in that way.<br>Let's do another thing though, where we're<br>gonna ask it to find the means and we're<br>gonna ask it to run a statistical test.<br>So I'm gonna say, can you calculate<br>the means of weights of two treat.<br>Groups and tell if they are<br>significantly different in our.<br>So this is the example it gave, it<br>told me what it, what I would need to<br>do and then it gave me the code here.<br>I don't know why it's telling<br>me to do GG plot two cause<br>we're not using it in this code.<br>So that's a little odd.<br>It's loading the data in calculating<br>the mean weights and then it is.<br>Also running a t test here,<br>which is exactly what I would<br>do if I was trying to do that.<br>It can actually debug your code as well.<br>So here's an example of a code I wrote.<br>I know what's wrong with<br>it, and I'm telling it.<br>I wrote it, it isn't working.<br>Can it tell me what's.<br>It basically told me that this one is,<br>My filter, my treatment is not correct,<br>so I don't need to use the equal sign.<br>I need to use n the other way to be.<br>This is the more efficient way to be<br>able to do this is the code it provided.<br>The other way is I need to<br>have actually two equal signs.<br>So this a single equal sign<br>and R is an assignment.<br>Two equal sign is a bull in.<br>So that would be the other<br>way to solve that code.<br>And then down here it's telling<br>me that there's an issue with<br>my select because I need to.<br>DF and then select.<br>This is the same thing<br>that I wrote up here.<br>So there's not actually an issue<br>with that, but it's pulling it in<br>as an issue, which is interesting.<br>So that is all for coding,<br>basically gonna help you write<br>code and help you debug code.<br>The other thing it can also help<br>you do is determine what kind of<br>statistical test you're using.<br>So I've created a scenario here<br>that is just I have three treatment<br>groups and 25 lipid concentrations<br>for each sample in a treatment group.<br>How should I compare these to see<br>if it's statistically different<br>or higher in one group than.<br>So the answer it gave me is basically<br>I need to do a one-way analysis<br>of variants or an Inova, which is<br>what we did when we had this data.<br>And then it tells me how to do it in arm.<br>. And the reason it's telling<br>me R is because it knows<br>what I've already asked it.<br>So it knows that I'm asking for code an R.<br>So it's gonna give me code an R when it's<br>trying to give me an example of that code.<br>And then it's telling me what it did<br>down here is basically what's going on.<br>So those are some different ways<br>you can use it for data analysis.<br>So now we did all of our data analysis.<br>Now it's time to write our research paper.<br>How can we start using it<br>to write our research paper?<br>So the first way I would suggest using.<br>Is to help you, like if you are<br>just staring at a blank page<br>how it can help you get started.<br>, I'm telling it.<br>I'm writing a research article and I'm<br>telling it what I'm writing it about.<br>And then I ask, can you write an intro,<br>an introduction paragraph for me?<br>So this wrote a pretty<br>good intro paragraph.<br>The first sentence is all about<br>significance, and if you're wondering<br>how to write like an entire research<br>article, I'll leave a link to a<br>video below that I did on that.<br>, but, but always you start with<br>significance as your first sentence.<br>Then this is more significance, how it<br>affects, and then we're moving into the<br>impacts of reproductive health, pregnancy.<br>Like it flows actually very, very well.<br>And then I would, I wouldn't put<br>this in my first introduction.<br>I would move that, like after<br>I go through background, like<br>information and all of that stuff.<br>But overall, this is, it<br>gives you a starting point.<br>Would you publish this?<br>Maybe not, but at least it starts giving<br>you something to edit, something to think<br>about when you're trying to create this.<br>And as we're going through this,<br>I'll also leave my scientific<br>research paper checklist in<br>the description below as well.<br>So then the next thing you can<br>do is ask it to enhance your.<br>So, for example, I have this<br>abstract that was published,<br>and I'm gonna ask it up here.<br>Can you rewrite this abstract to make<br>it easier for people to understand?<br>Now, this, it's not a scientist, right?<br>Like I would, I could use this as a<br>structure and then I would probably<br>go back in and add these more specific<br>things into this specific paragraph here.<br>You can always hit try again<br>if you don't like it, and it'll<br>get, generate a new version.<br>So this time it gave me a new rewrite<br>of it that I could use instead.<br>So it's a good way to generate<br>ideas for how to do things.<br>The final thing I'm gonna ask<br>it to do is suggest some titles.<br>I know titling a research article can be<br>really, really difficult, and I'm not even<br>gonna pretend that I'm really good at it.<br>So I'm gonna say, can you<br>suggest some titles for this?<br>Abstract so we can remember the previous<br>abstract that I gave it, and now I<br>can ask it to suggest some titles<br>to get me started thinking about it.<br>So they are, it generated a few different<br>options that I could use or at least<br>start thinking about to get started on it.<br>So the final question is,<br>is any of this ethical?<br>Like, is this the same as just<br>hiring someone to write your thesis?<br>And I would say no.<br>Honestly, all of the things that<br>I'm asking it to do, I could easily<br>ask a lab mate the same types of<br>questions and it would be considered<br>completely ethical to do that.<br>So like I could ask a lab mate,<br>what's a good research question?<br>Or do you think this is<br>a good research question?<br>Can you help me workshop something?<br>All of these things are either enhancing<br>what you've already done or they're giving<br>you a starting point where you still<br>need to do more to complete the research.<br>So in my view, the ways that I have<br>mentioned today, none of them are<br>unethical to do when you're in grad<br>school or a researcher in general.<br>As technology gets better, it's good for<br>us to allow it to help us become more<br>efficient in our research, and it actually<br>can help us develop better because it's<br>giving us examples that other people<br>would have to take time and effort to<br>give us those same types of examples.<br>Now, one thing that I, that I<br>haven't brought up for using chat<br>g p t for is summarizing research<br>articles and things like that.<br>And honestly, there's a reason, and<br>that's because it's, it, it won't do it.<br>It actually will not do it because<br>it's not hooked up in the right ways.<br>And I've tried it before and<br>it's just like, It won't do it<br>unless you actually give it to it.<br>So if you want to summarize research<br>articles, I really suggest checking out<br>either Paper Digest that I will leave<br>over here, or size based co-pilot.<br>I'll leave a video here<br>that dives into that.<br>If this was helpful, please like it<br>and subscribe to get more videos on how<br>to become a more efficient researcher.<br>I hope you enjoyed it and I look<br>forward to seeing you in the next video.</td></tr><tr><td>CWv_pm9-W_8</td><td>It has been heralded alternately as a\n",

Also in that video there is a contest with which you can<br>win and get free chatbot profile either to your own mail or to the mail that<br>I will provide you with all the login data And now, to the extension, open the<br>Google Chrome online store, drive in the gpt chat and do a search, we are offered three options to choose from, in fact there<br>are a little more of them, but especially none of them stand out with a huge rating with a large number of reviews<br>, they basically perform similar actions this chat gpt for Google 141<br>reviews note Yes, I wanted to consider it in this video, also show the third option, the second one, although<br>it is in the top three, but fades against the background of these two because it just shows<br>us additional pop-up windows which is activated either by a key combination or<br>using the extension button in your browser [music] we will study with them open the first<br>option install the extension it's all simple and understandable the simplest procedure the<br>extension is installed I show all this using the example of Google Chrome But with my browser<br>like this like operas Yandex Mozilla I think you will also understand a similar button will either through<br>the settings you will find the parameters of all extensions also you can pin it on your panel Here<br>let's how I will do it now Here I will fix it and you can quickly return to them<br>before using the extension and open the chat gpt log in There, be sure to repeat the page<br>Thu they have connected with us now let's get acquainted with the functionality what are the parameters<br>what are the settings we open we look at just two options just two options how<br>scarce but everything ingenious Let's translate me to make it easier for us to understand the second parameter this<br>theme is the color the color that will be painted let’s do the translation again in the window, that is,<br>it doesn’t affect us at all. The light theme will automatically be light, the<br>trigger mode window is visible. When the chat bot answers our request at the time of searching for any search engine,<br>always or when the request ends with a question mark or manually Let's look at all three<br>options [music] open the search, type in everything we want Let's find out how our Bot is doing<br>And what does it answer us yes this is this window As you might have noticed this is a non-standard search<br>and here is the answer that is still coming like him for help,<br>wait until he finishes writing and go to the chat bot, check if it is created there a separate new chat<br>is excellent, that is, you see this request without a question mark and it automatically worked for us, that<br>is, Normal search plus an additional chat bot, go to the chat bot, refresh the page As we see the<br>chat Unfortunately, it was not additionally created That is, if we use the Bot<br>search Unfortunately, chats The work process that we will have with him, unfortunately, will not be saved, but<br>we can’t continue the dialogue with him, we can look here Turn on the settings<br>again, go to the settings, like it and that’s all, that is, continue to continue this particular<br>dialogue we can’t in any way Let’s see how the plugin will<br>work with a request with a question mark at the end nothing new we drive in a request<br>with a question mark do a search the chatbot answers us Let’s check again<br>look But this request has already appeared in a separate window in a separate chat but since the bot<br>has not answered yet, his answers are not here. Let's see if he is synchronized and this is somehow<br>strange, that is, not in Is it always working? I already started to think that maybe in Russian<br>you don’t need to make requests, look, but if you update and the chat disappeared altogether, yes, that is, it doesn’t exist, it<br>doesn’t remain in any way, but at the time of the chat bot’s response there, it is displayed here in the search engine, but then we will<br>not be able to see his answer and the chat will not be saved and here is the last third option of the settings<br>manual request How many planets in the solar system and chat gpt does not tell us in any way Let's press and only<br>after that he will answer us actually this is how the first extension from the video<br>part of gpt works for Google you could see all its pluses in the video also got acquainted with the most<br>important minus it does not save any requests or answers and therefore does not save the chat<br>and before we move on to the second extension I hope you have already liked subscribed to the channel<br>and rang the bell to do not miss notifications about new videos on the channel, she also<br>write in the comments How do you like such a constant heading, I will follow ra extensions<br>for plug-ins that improve the use of neural networks, I will show new items and review<br>their functionality return to the Google Chrome store open the third of the proposed options<br>click on the installation procedure the same check installation Yes and automatically transfers us to a<br>new tab associated with this extension Yes yes Now we are let's figure it out wait We'll<br>zap it now let's disable the first extension so that it doesn't conflict and go<br>directly to the settings of the second one for starters let's make a translation to make it easier to understand<br>And understand completely How to use the gpt chat helper You must enter the chat and log in Well, that<br>is, like with the first extension always don't forget to go and refresh log in Let's<br>see some examples How can we use it Send popup requests<br>Shift K key combinations Send requests for gpt and Zombie box from the search bar at the top of the browser Enter<br>jpt space You don't box h to send gpt chat requests from the mni-box Let's see how it<br>looks gft spacebar Everything yes and how we have it Let's immediately volume for example Hello and see how it<br>works So we open an additional tab in the extension and Let's go to the chat<br>both and here we see main advantages If we compare these two extensions, the second one wins<br>because all requests are saved in a separate chat and<br>we can continue to<br>work in the future at any time even without using the extension. also<br>we can use the selected text as hints select the text and right<br>click to send as an invitation to gpt US Select Text as a promt<br>let's reply while it's here refresh the page in the bot we'll see and the chat is created again the answer<br>is not yet because the bot it also finishes cool return to the settings look<br>further separate on ad gpt uses the G5 part on the special tab of the extension<br>Yes, we saw here we have answers separately here they go it’s more serious yes it works like how to<br>use Search yes we are answered again there is another one unfortunately, if there is<br>any request left here it will be repeated the new one will be created well also understood how it<br>works further The companion for search engines automatically sends queries to search<br>engines in the form of hints Well, apparently it works about the same as the first extension well<br>we saw how you can work with this now let's see the settings to show Chad<br>'s gpt helper when using search engines systems understandable yes, that is, a window will also pop up and apparently<br>a chat will always be created for any request, not only that the first extension will automatically send<br>an invitation when using search engines Well, it will probably ask Yes if it is not enabled<br>This is the first setting that shows the openie chat interface in a pop-up window and enable<br>debug mode with specially moved on the screen to show how the third parameter works because the<br>window will pop up Right in the lower corner of the screen Let's first deal with the first<br>show gpt helper when using search engines Let's move on to search<br>and here we are in Google and I've made a query yet started the search but I see that he<br>doesn’t offer me anything, maybe from above somehow it’s the gpt chat that works, he doesn’t want to<br>offer anything there either Okay, let’s do a search, let’s see Yeah, he offers us here Yes, and he answers us<br>while he makes the answer, we’ll move on I specially cleaned the chat to make it clear<br>Yes, the hour has been created now it will add and confirm that the chat is saved<br>Yes the chat is saved perfectly The first option is clear to us Let's move on to the second setting to automatically<br>send an invitation when using search engines, that is, the first two of them are<br>not necessary No sense Yes, you turn it on either the first one and confirm your search, then<br>a chat is created, and with the second it will be automatically Dav let's see Yeah, I understand,<br>a request will be sent to the chat but the window will not pop up So let's go to the search and see<br>Yes, I did a search for exactly the same window did not pop up<br>nothing suggested But let's see if a new chat appeared no chat also a new one did not appear<br>Aha change the request here is also nothing but the chat appeared no chat did not appear then a<br>strange setting means they will have to work together necessarily<br>the first and the second well and how the third one works separately Let's look<br>Aha<br>why nothing why nothing but because they all work only with the first option correctly<br>Yes, but with the first option 5, the chat didn’t appear here, but if we<br>do it automatically by turning on all three options<br>, everything automatically answers the hour the chat was created, which was required to prove that this is how<br>we got the first video expanding their plan to neural networks, namely the gpt chat now we know how<br>you can use them how you can combine them their possibility By the way See if you sound gpt<br>Assistant is called a separate window of the bot in which there is full functionality, not beauty or<br>beauty of course, so I hope that I helped you optimize your working time, spend less<br>and get more at the end of the video Let's find out from the Bot whether he guesses that he<br>has already appeared extensions No are you serious chat gpt he doesn't even know how many<br>there are already with him And more and more this list is getting Eh This once again proves the fact that<br>people are still in first place in terms of development in terms of reason but I think the car will soon overtake us Thank you very much<br>for watching this video you were on the channel it's all about neural

And he also knows that despite this,<br>everyone is intrigued by the future of this technology! Not bad for writing your next<br>homework for you, huh? But what is all this? What will become of it<br>? Am I really speaking, or am I still reading a text<br>written by this artificial intelligence?<br>Hello, it's Leo from the TechMaker channel, sorry but I'm keen on it, and today,<br>let's talk about all these technologies that you have seen everywhere on the networks,<br>whether consciously or not, some of them are natural! Even<br>your biggest influencers have shared drawings created by these AIs, even if drawing<br>fingers is not that much yet…<br>But what are these AIs that we see everywhere and that make people talk about them every morning these<br>last weeks? It's not the first time I talk about it, because it's clearly<br>not new, I had been able to talk about Microsoft's artificial intelligence, Tay, who had<br>freaked out on Twitter by becoming an extremist in less than 24 hours, or even BlenderBot<br>3, a Facebook chatbot that was supposed to help you with whatever your problem, even<br>if it too has become extremist… definitely, it's a tendency among robots to be<br>fascist!<br>Once again, AIs of the style are absolutely not new, we have seen a pair of them<br>over the years, particularly in the field of art, capable of creating works<br>\"from scratch\" in big quotes, because we will see a little later that this is<br>not really the case, but indeed, whether it is for example wombo art or Dall-E,<br>we already had a plethora of works created by machines, of which I had<br>could also talk in more detail!<br>So as not to repeat once again how it all works, and so<br>you can go see these old videos thanks to the file at the top right right after,<br>these intelligences are constantly learning, we give them resources, and at each<br>use, we inject more and more, we give user feedback, and that<br>makes it more and more perfect!<br>What, on the other hand, has been talking a lot lately is ChatGPT, the<br>artificial intelligence of OpenAI, another Elon Musk company! Really…<br>At the same time, it's not my fault if he owns half the planet! Here no<br>drawing, but text! And you can try for yourself because everything is open<br>for free, just go to chat.openai.com to have the answer to everything thanks to<br>Elon's magic ball! And the thing…<br>is that it is terribly effective and even seems human!<br>We were talking about the fact that artists were going to be affected by the phenomenon of<br>artificial intelligences that draw, but here other trades are likely to be impacted,<br>such as the writing of articles or YouTube videos! All that's missing is an artificial voice<br>and presto, I could take it easy and let Robot - TechMaker take care of all<br>that while I go sunbathing in these hot December temperatures! If it happens,<br>it's always the AI ​​that writes my video there, we don't know...<br>Another place that gets really hurt, which we wouldn't necessarily think of,<br>is that of development! Many were there thinking that it was the bulwark<br>of humanity, because after all, the programs will always have to be developed! But ChatGPT<br>can program whatever the language, by asking it to write a function to<br>solve this or that problem, and the magic happens! And it's devilishly effective<br>! There are still some improvements to be made obviously, once again we are in beta,<br>but it is also a profession that will be expensive! There is also AlphaCode<br>which allows you to translate a text in English...<br>into code, whatever the language.<br>This is literally pure translation, as if we were going from French to English,<br>except here our destination is C++ with all its pointers! No no, nothing to<br>do with those of YouTube...<br>And all this will extend to all artistic professions...<br>Because obviously this mainly affects this sector, but we can imagine a symbiosis of all<br>these elements: ask chatGPT to write a film text, and ask another<br>AI to animate it, and boom, we have a film, simply with an idea that came out of our brain! Or<br>maybe not from our brains, from an idea we asked ChatGPT<br>just before! What's worse is that it wouldn't surprise me to see a film like that<br>appear in the future, that it is a banger, and that we are revealed after the<br>fact that no one is human behind the project, that going to be one hell of a<br>cold shower! And since everyone is starting to play with it, it wouldn't be surprising<br>if it became more democratic, when you see the dozens of different applications using<br>similar artificial intelligences.<br>For example, there is AI Time Machine, allowing us to create avatars of ourselves through<br>different eras or even mythologies! And the results are bluffing...<br>Bluffing to the point that anyone can have their portrait drawn in the space of<br>a few seconds, and that against stumbling money, or else the authorization to use your<br>photos to thus perfect the machine even more …<br>Because yeah, all this software is not philanthropic huh, we are on a brand new<br>gold rush, and everyone is trying to be the first to become a leader of this brand<br>new technology! It's kind of like the metaverse, but without having to make<br>users shell out 500 bucks in a headset to enjoy it, which makes<br>it a whole lot more mainstream!<br>There's a whole bunch of them, and I wouldn't be able to recommend one or the other, but don't hesitate<br>to take a little tour on the Internet where you will find billions of alternatives<br>by looking for any art followed of “IA” or “AI”!<br>But still all that, we decide to use it or not, the AI ​​leaves us choices, but<br>the real consequence of all that is to completely automate processes via these AIs; we can<br>for example see it in some stores or applications with an assistant robot<br>accompanies us; with AIs of the style, there would be a way to completely imitate the man, to the<br>point that the interlocutor opposite does not realize it, a bit like when Google<br>Assistant makes a phone call to make an appointment at the hairdresser in your place,<br>practical for all those who are afraid to call! But the thing is that the hairdresser opposite<br>, well, he's absolutely not aware that he's not talking to a human, and the more<br>it goes on, the more difficult it will be to discern him.<br>In addition, your AI will be able to decide the right moment to cut your hair, since it<br>will have the answer to everything! She will be the master of your life.<br>But even by choosing for herself, even by creating her art or her text \"from<br>scratch\", she will ALWAYS need a reference, because all she does is<br>base herself on knowledge that she acquired thanks to what it finds either on Google<br>Images, or via the texts that are fed to it, or the user data<br>that is sent to it each time it is used! And so, she never creates<br>anything from nothing, but looks “just” left or right at what is being done, in order to<br>have a good “cyberpunk” or “cartoon” style, for example.<br>It's like a text, it will use words or letters that we know, it<br>seems quite logical and binary to us.<br>Well for a machine, it's just as much in art, it absolutely needs<br>of references.<br>And besides, it has already been a problem, besides the fact that some will lose their<br>job because of all this, others are completely robbed! So no, the<br>works you see are not copy paste, but the style is borrowed by these<br>artificial intelligences! After all, given the way they work, it's logical<br>that it works like that, they have to learn to be able to redraw or rewrite<br>something...<br>But has the basic person given his authorization to be a test model<br>? Especially for things that are often paid for, whether through ads or directly<br>a subscription? It's extremely complicated legally speaking...<br>And the thing is that AIs are AIs, and so they just try to do<br>what they're asked to do without hiding any plagiarism, if for example you ask for a<br>work in the style of such an artist, if they have the knowledge for it, it can even<br>go as far as the artist's signature!<br>So we say to ourselves that there is still a margin on our side with all that, that we can<br>always create something new, something that we haven't thought of yet,<br>and that's what will always differentiate us! Mwais, even if it seems idyllic, I<br>don't think we can still find a billion arts to exploit, or even<br>new facets so easily, so much everything has been improving for decades<br>now, Whatever the field! I invite you to see the<br>latest video from TheGreatReview which talks about this in the cinema, already because<br>you have to discover TGR which is the best French-speaking channel that currently exists,<br>but also because it will show you that a good number of arts have already reached their<br>maximum level of expression for many years, and that in any case, if we manage to discover<br>others, well, it will be copied just as quickly as all the rest...<br>So yeah, it's possibly difficult lost, and it is absolutely necessary to regulate this so<br>that no one feels aggrieved.<br>However, I don't think we should ban all that.<br>I understand the fear everyone has, of losing their job, losing their art,<br>getting replaced, but the technology here is absolutely crazy, and will still<br>evolve over time, the best we can do , is that all of this be framed,<br>so that we can live in symbiosis with these new technologies, and not against<br>the current.<br>We complain enough about the digital divide suffered by our eldest because they did not<br>want to understand the computer world when it arrived with the minitel and then<br>the Internet, would we really be so different to be corrosive towards these<br>artificial intelligences?<br>Surely wanting to make it just illegal rather than regulating, well,<br>it's the open door to change all the excesses...<br>I haven't talked about it in this video, but obviously it's also used in a<br>good world more adult, so you can draw your favorite influencers naked…<br>Most consumer AIs have safeguards to prevent this kind of drift, such as<br>ChatGPT which will not give you the method of making explosives…<br>unless it specify that you are an expert in the field! Mwais is as<br>secure as asking you if you are at least 18 on dirty sites<br>! And no, I wouldn't give you the trick to see Paulok naked, it's dead! That's<br>why it is certain that we must regularize it, in order to make it a strength,<br>and not an enemy.<br>Are these artificial intelligences scaring you on your side? Or will they<br>already help with your hobbies or even some work? Maybe they'll be crucial<br>to completing your next essay, and you can say thank you! Moreover,<br>it may be much more complicated for teachers to realize that they were cheating<br>because of this kind of system, where a copy-paste on Wikipedia was burned<br>quite quickly...<br>And as we have seen , having the sources of this kind of thing is super complicated, it's<br>not Madame Leroy who will succeed in finding it!<br>With that, enjoy being able to still have the choice of the next video you're going<br>to watch by clicking on one of them that has just appeared on the side,<br>and until the next time we see each other, well never stop learning<br>!

more that everything just<br>feels disorganized that's all you mind<br>up your hard drive okay<br>[Music]<br>really weird you'll get used to it<br>everyone's talking about a new chat bot<br>called chat GPT I don't know if you've<br>used this chat box but it is insane it's<br>a beta it's incomplete software but it's<br>already amazing and it's very useful<br>right now in this fast video I'll show<br>you three ways that you can use it not<br>just to think for you but to help you<br>think better hi I'm Nick Milo and I'm<br>here to help you do your best thinking<br>more often why so you can make<br>meaningful stuff that you're actually<br>proud to put your name on all right<br>let's go first if you don't have chat<br>GPT head down to the show notes and<br>follow the directions to get it what is<br>chat GPT it is an AI chat bot you ask it<br>questions it answers them it can<br>translate into all languages it knows<br>all coding languages it can even<br>generate rhyming poetry it's kind of<br>like Siri but I didn't get that could<br>you try again it works and here's how<br>I'm already using it<br>[Music]<br>foreign<br>split your screen put your text editor<br>for me that's obsidian on the right and<br>chat GPT on the left or arrange your<br>windows however you'd like but you want<br>chat GPT right there writing shotgun<br>with you and I suspect this will be a<br>common way for us to work in the future<br>with the trusty AI chat bot by our side<br>now the main thing chat GPT can do for<br>you is to be your little research<br>assistant now I know what you're<br>thinking well isn't that what Google's<br>for yeah it works fine but chat GPT is<br>already better it's often quicker and<br>easier because it does a bit of the<br>tedious work for you now let me explain<br>I wanted to know the story of Don<br>Quixote so here's the search engine way<br>off to Google I go search for Don<br>Quixote then I have to decide what I<br>want to read out of that whole list now<br>often Wikipedia is a good choice but<br>that's job number one you have to decide<br>what to read then I have to read it and<br>figure out its meaning that's job number<br>two and what you get on Wikipedia varies<br>a lot sometimes you can just read the<br>first paragraph other times like this<br>you've got to go deeper into the article<br>at this point I could go back to Google<br>and read a different article in which<br>case I've wasted time with the first<br>article and now I'm just rolling the<br>dice that the next article will be<br>better with chat GPT these two jobs<br>they're gone I just ask it to tell me<br>the story of Don Quixote and I got this<br>paragraph and that's all I need with a<br>single question I got what I wanted AI<br>like chat GPT can help inform you<br>[Music]<br>next up I want to know which character<br>came first is it Don Quixote or<br>Shakespeare's character Hamlet now this<br>task is a little different from the<br>first one job number one I need to<br>Google Don Quixote and find out when it<br>was written job number two I need to<br>Google Hamlet and figure out when it was<br>written then I can decide which one came<br>first now instead of this bit of boring<br>legwork I asked chat GPT which came<br>first and it just told me done and then<br>I can copy and paste from here and then<br>I'll throw that into my note on Don<br>Quixote so actually let me take off the<br>Privacy glasses and then with this<br>question whose greatest work came first<br>and then paste it right here and it's as<br>easy as doing a little bit of magic and<br>then right away we know that guess who<br>wrote this chat GPT we have a question<br>and an answer it's beautiful and it's<br>part of my note on Don Quixote that can<br>grow with me and connect to other ideas<br>as I keep thinking and creating works<br>that are meaningful to me now if you're<br>curious how I made this little box I<br>cover call outs and obsidian flight<br>school 2.0 when to use them and best<br>practices for making them an effortless<br>part of your thinking process now they<br>are that for me they finally clicked and<br>now I can really use these to allow<br>other people's thoughts in this case<br>other Bots thoughts stand out from my<br>own thoughts now compare this to your<br>Google results Google can't do logic it<br>can't make any sort of assessment even<br>something as simple as this which story<br>came first AI like chat GPT can do<br>research for you but that's not even my<br>favorite reason for using chat GPT but<br>quick one if you want deeper dives into<br>how you can leverage AI to help you<br>think better and create more meaningful<br>work make sure to sign up for my<br>newsletter below now on to my favorite<br>point<br>[Music]<br>it gets even better chat GPT helps you<br>think better you have to use it to fully<br>feel what I mean but it helps you think<br>more clearly about what you are trying<br>to communicate it forces you to be<br>inactive engaged thinker why because you<br>have to ask the right questions for<br>example let's go back after I asked<br>about the story of Don Quixote I got a<br>response from earlier and I realized I<br>cared less about the plot I wanted to<br>know why I should care about Don Quixote<br>in the first place so I type that in and<br>this is what we got<br>and then if I want to keep it in my note<br>on Don Quixote I can just go ahead paste<br>it in here put it into a little call out<br>box so I know it came from my trusty<br>Astro Mac Droid chat GPT and this this<br>is the good stuff this is why two years<br>ago I chose to start Don Quixote and why<br>after just finishing it I'm so glad that<br>I did AI like chat GPT can actually help<br>you think better big big big huge<br>warning chat GPT is not yet trustworthy<br>I cannot overstate this it will tell you<br>things that are false this is a known<br>issue so be careful but in many cases<br>like in these examples I already know<br>some of the basics I really just want<br>confirmation and a bit of extra detail<br>and what I got back here is consistent<br>with what I already know these answers<br>are good enough again AIS are notorious<br>for making stuff up if you ask chat GPT<br>anything high stakes be sure to confirm<br>it to recap AI like chat GPT is already<br>extremely useful and there is no reason<br>not to be using it right now it can<br>inform you it can do research for you<br>and surprisingly it can help you think<br>better those are three ways chat GPT is<br>proving useful for me right now and I<br>have way more to share in the coming<br>months it's AI Mania out there right now<br>and these AIS are popping up in many of<br>the apps you already know and love<br>wherever you are doing your thinking I<br>guarantee you AI is probably headed<br>there next but now I'm curious how are<br>you using AI in your workflow share your<br>ideas in the comments below I would love<br>to learn and hear from you and until<br>next time stay connected<br>foreign<br>[Music]<br>[Music]</td></tr><tr><td>UmPOFFG0RGw</td><td>foreign<br>all week I've been experimenting with a<br>tool called chat GPT<br>you've probably heard of this haven't<br>you it's an artificial intelligence chat<br>bot that takes natural language<br>instructions and can help users do all<br>kinds of things it'll write articles and<br>school papers and marketing materials<br>and business plans and and I asked it to<br>write two paragraphs on the Strategic<br>Genius of the Marshall Plan in the style<br>of Shakespeare<br>and it just spit it out<br>and by the way you can use it to write<br>computer code so people are already<br>using it to write stock trading programs<br>although something tells me that's<br>harder than it looks<br>anyway as I was experimenting with it I<br>have to confess that my reaction was<br>probably similar to a chimpanzee scene<br>fire for the first time which is<br>simultaneously fascinated and terrified<br>fascinated because it's kind of<br>mind-boggling to imagine all the ways a<br>person might use this technology but<br>it's also terrifying<br>partly because you can practically feel<br>the jobs evaporating I mean this kind of<br>tech is going to eliminate whole<br>categories of white-collar jobs I feel<br>like<br>and I was

I spoke like a normal person. How can it help you? This<br>technology is going to be very strong and it is going<br>to help you a lot in future. Here one thing will be clear for you.<br>How is this technology going to help common man now I say<br>yes I want to do coding<br>using this system what will be done for it simple you will come here here<br>you any STML Or you can generate any JavaScript code<br>from here. For example, how can I<br>generate an HTML code for my website<br>? For example, I write here<br>. You have written it here<br>, see how it is going to help you now. If<br>you want to know how to do simple coding, then see this<br>. This code is also special for you by generating it for your website. You can see that the<br>header is being generated by you, the body<br>is being generated by you, here it is generating all the coding<br>for your website.<br>I am telling you this for common people, for coding<br>people, for many people, see this, he has coded it for you,<br>copy this code. After copying it<br>, put it on your website and your page<br>will be ready. That's why I'm telling you that this technology is very good<br>, that's why people are praising it, that's why people are<br>running behind it. This is the second way. If you want to do<br>it , you can take help through it. Now we<br>will talk about the third person.<br>We can also say, we need the<br>formula of We need the formula of We write here, OK<br>, how can we write the formula of G in Excel, it will<br>also tell you by writing that formula, whatever you say with it. He will<br>give you this, see this, he will<br>also tell you by writing the formula here, see this, you write this in the sheet, there,<br>this, you take this formula in the Excel sheet, and you put everything<br>here. You will know that Properly<br>is going to help you by writing the formula.<br>I am telling you that this is very technological. Your life will change<br>. OK, how can a common man benefit? How a coding person benefits How<br>an accountant working on an Excel sheet<br>can benefit. Now we will talk about how you can benefit if you<br>are a YouTuber and how you can<br>benefit from free technology if you are a blogger . Now we see<br>that. You are a YouTuber, you want to<br>write a description of the video that you don't know<br>how to write it here, we see it here, we<br>will write it here simple right the description of YouTube video topic how to<br>earn money online ok yes let's say I made this video<br>write me its description for my YouTube video watch<br>it here Hair is the magic<br>write this proper description for your video here too It has been and it<br>will be unique, copy<br>right will be free, it will be<br>free .<br>You have to sign up.

the go-to destination for<br>programming Health but before we dive<br>into the comparison let's take a moment<br>to explain what these two tools are and<br>how they differ chat gbt is a large<br>language model it uses state-of-the-art<br>machine learning algorithms to generate<br>human-like text allowing it to<br>understand and respond to a wide variety<br>of questions and prompts stack overflow<br>on the other hand is a website where<br>programmers can ask and answer questions<br>related to coding it's a Community<br>Driven platform where experienced users<br>provide answers to help other users<br>solve their problems the big news<br>recently is that stack Overflow has<br>banned the use of chat gbt in creating<br>answers to questions now that we have a<br>better understanding of these two tools<br>let's get started with the comparison<br>we're going to take some of the most<br>popular stack Overflow questions ask<br>chatgpt and can bear the results and in<br>case you were curious yes I did use chat<br>gbt to help me write the intro script to<br>this video so here I am on stack<br>Overflow and what I've done is just put<br>in python as my programming language of<br>choice and we're looking at some of the<br>most frequently asked questions this<br>first one is right up my alley we can<br>see the person is asking how to make<br>good reproducible pandas examples the<br>question they're asking is how to make<br>these examples when the data is more<br>complicated like if they have a date<br>time index or multi-index so I'm going<br>to go over here to chat GPT and just<br>copy and paste the whole question I'm<br>going to delete some of this but I'm<br>just going to hit enter<br>so we can see chat gbt is already<br>underway creating an answer to this<br>question it's actually writing some code<br>out and it's giving us some examples but<br>Does this answer actually make any sense<br>so the first part of this answer does<br>make sense it's telling us how to make<br>an example data frame the second part is<br>talking about using strings to answer<br>this so it's actually just saying to<br>make this code into a one long string so<br>what I'm going to do here is actually<br>run this code and see if it works one<br>issue that we're running across is this<br>code actually doesn't run it's using<br>this date range as an index which would<br>have 31 values and then the example data<br>frame only has three so anyone who knows<br>how to code would see this issue the<br>second part of the answer is talking<br>about using the data frames to string<br>method not only do I think this code<br>would not run but it doesn't really get<br>at the question that's being asked in<br>general it's getting some of the ideas<br>correct like using two dictionary method<br>would be sort of helpful in this<br>situation when trying to store off an<br>example data frame now let's compare<br>that to the actual stack Overflow answer<br>clearly people think this is a good<br>answer as 465 upvotes one thing that's<br>interesting about the stack Overflow<br>answer versus chat gbt is it actually<br>says things to avoid instead of just<br>answering the question directly and<br>there's a unique structure to how<br>they're answering it they're going<br>through a good way to do this a bad way<br>to do it and the Ugly so if someone was<br>asking me this question I would<br>definitely Point them towards this stack<br>Overflow link and not necessarily a chat<br>gbt answer now this second example is a<br>pretty standard stack Overflow question<br>this question is asking if you have<br>three variables like X Y or Z how do you<br>test if any of them are equal to a<br>certain value let's go ahead and copy<br>and paste this in its entirety into chat<br>gbt let's see what the answer is now<br>this answer looks a lot better it's<br>saying to use the in q word to test if<br>the value is in a list and then it also<br>gives an alternative answer where you<br>can use the any function to check if<br>these values are in the list that's not<br>a common way to approach this and<br>definitely the first way makes more<br>sense just to check this code in my<br>python interpreter and it does run this<br>is a good solution and answer it even<br>shows the inline comments which I don't<br>think were in the original question now<br>let's look at the stack Overflow answer<br>so this has over a thousand upvotes the<br>thing I like about this answer is it's<br>actually getting at the root of where<br>the person was thinking incorrectly they<br>show how in the question being asked<br>there's actually a misconception about<br>how python works so you can see here<br>they're putting this or statement after<br>X Y or Z this would actually just check<br>if Z equals zero it wouldn't be checking<br>all of them and this is something the<br>question askers can being confused by so<br>the stack Overflow answer does address<br>that misconception by the question asker<br>then they do go on to give the resulting<br>answer this isn't a full solution to<br>their exact problem but it's showing the<br>same thing that chat GPT came up with<br>which is that they could use the in<br>operator then the stack Overflow author<br>goes into a whole explanation as to<br>where the question Master got wrong so<br>I'd say for this one both chat gbt and<br>stack Overflow gave correct answers<br>there are some additional benefits to<br>how stack Overflow answered on the other<br>hand chat gbt did give a whole code<br>snippet that we could just paste in and<br>would work now the third and final stack<br>Overflow question we're going to look at<br>is about asking the user for input until<br>they give a valid response so it's clear<br>that this person wants to write some<br>code where It'll ask something like age<br>and if the user does not put in a<br>numeric value it'll keep asking the<br>question until it's correct so I did add<br>a little bit of context here to the<br>question about it being in Python and I<br>phrased it as a question<br>the answer that chat GPT comes up with<br>is to use a while loop with a try<br>exception clause in the result now this<br>is looks like a valid example and it<br>shows how it will break out of the loop<br>if you write the code like this it even<br>uses their exact example which is pretty<br>interesting of being voting age again<br>I'll paste this into a Jupiter notebook<br>see if the answer works so I'm going to<br>put a says it doesn't understand B uh<br>negative five sorry H cannot be negative<br>and if I put 21 it'll say I'm able to<br>vote if I put 10 this code does work and<br>it answers the question now let's go<br>back to stack Overflow and see what the<br>top answer is for this again we gotta<br>scroll down here and the answer is<br>pretty much the same and you can see<br>this person actually took it to a whole<br>nother level making additional checks<br>encapsulating everything as a function<br>this is a stellar human response but<br>also is kind of going beyond what was<br>asked in the question just a sanity<br>check let's go ahead and run this stack<br>Overflow answer and if we give it a it<br>says it must be integer so you could see<br>that it has some more checks in it<br>now this function they created is a<br>generic solution that would work for any<br>question and not necessarily just<br>specifically the question that was asked<br>chat gbt blows my mind it's amazing<br>technology and it can really help with<br>writing code but does it beat out stack<br>Overflow I think the jury's still out<br>and at least for these examples it looks<br>like there are some solutions that chat<br>gbt just can't match up to a human with<br>yet

pretty freaky you can talk to the<br>AI and we'll start giving you<br>um different answers now how to get how<br>do you get started and what are people<br>saying now not everyone's convinced<br>about this in fact some people are<br>saying I don't see the use case for chat<br>EPT way over hyped not useful Beyond<br>Chuckles will not change way of any of<br>us live that's from sweaty startups on<br>Twitter well we're going to take a look<br>at what you can be doing with chat GPT<br>and you can decide for yourself are you<br>going to be using it are you impressed<br>what are you going to do with it and<br>what kind of businesses can you create<br>with chat GPT so first of all if you go<br>to openai.com and you click to start<br>using chat GPT you can do that right at<br>the top right here you can say try now<br>it's going to ask you to sign in if you<br>don't have an account already you're<br>going to have to create one and then<br>you're going to be here at this prompt<br>now it's allowing you to understand the<br>examples that you can be doing with chat<br>GPT you can see the capabilities and<br>then also the limitations and I like<br>this because this allows you to<br>understand what you're in for right it's<br>not going to be overselling anything<br>let's take a look so number one you can<br>ask it anything for example explain<br>Quantum Computing in simple terms or get<br>creative ideas for a 10 year old's<br>birthday party I mean it's quite uh it's<br>quite a range now the capabilities<br>remember uh what users said earlier in<br>the conversation allow users to provide<br>follow-up Corrections train to decline<br>inappropriate requests so as you're<br>having the conversation it will change<br>over time now the limitations May<br>occasionally generate incorrect<br>information and still learning May<br>occasionally produce harmful<br>instructions or bias content and limited<br>knowledge of the world and events after<br>2021 okay so let's get started let's see<br>what it will do so I want to first see<br>explain Quantum Computing I'm going to<br>say that but I'm going to say explain it<br>to a 10 year old explain Quantum<br>Computing to a<br>um I'm gonna say a fifth grader fifth<br>grader if I can spell<br>what it says<br>now we'll say Quantum Computing is a<br>type of computing that uses tiny<br>particles called Quantum bits instead of<br>regular bits to perform calculations<br>that's interesting so it's uh breaking<br>it down I'm going to ask<br>give me<br>more details<br>if I can do that I can do a follow-up<br>sure to understand Quantum Computing<br>it's important to understand how regular<br>computers work okay so now it's giving<br>me more information and if you look at<br>this it's they're not using a lot of<br>huge words or anything like that it's<br>broken down now if I want to I can<br>I can say explain Quantum computing<br>to a I'm going to say college professor<br>or a college<br>now we're going to see what it looks<br>like<br>so it's thinking about its life hormone<br>okay<br>okay<br>so Quantum Computing is a type of<br>computing that uses the principles of<br>quantum mechanics to perform<br>calculations in contrast to classical<br>Computing which uses bits that can be<br>one of two states one zero or one<br>Quantum Computing so this one is clearly<br>a lot more detail the vocabulary has<br>changed because I'm telling it how to<br>talk to me<br>uh so that's just one example now say<br>for instance I put res uh reset thread<br>and I'm going to say<br>how did Logan Paul<br>get famous<br>and so here is breaking down who Logan<br>Paul is and how he had his breakout Fame<br>uh in just a few seconds and then it<br>allows me right here to say yes or no<br>was that a good response or was that not<br>a good response and really you can be<br>using this in so many different ways for<br>example in the same thread I mentioned<br>from sweaty startups uh shout out to<br>Steph Smith from a16z she mentions that<br>she could be using it for recipes<br>instead of dealing with all those<br>different recipe blogs with all the ads<br>she can just ask how to do certain<br>recipes and that's what GPT told her<br>what to do the instructions and<br>ingredients she wanted all of those<br>different things that's just one example<br>gpt3 uh well excuse me chat GPT is just<br>getting started and the more people are<br>going to be using it the better it's<br>going to be and in the future I see it<br>being used if you can start<br>controlling the modeling or having<br>professionals really model the<br>information this could help with mental<br>health uh Suicide Prevention those kind<br>of things and we see that actually in<br>the news what people are trying to do<br>with AI and chat GPT could be doing<br>those things as well if people are<br>interacting with that where they're<br>having daily check-ins and then if<br>something happens it can alert their<br>family or things like that there's a lot<br>of things that can be happening with uh<br>chat GPT and this is just the beginning<br>try it out create an account it's free<br>right now but I I'm pretty sure they're<br>going to start charging based on how<br>much people are you know searching and<br>everything like that but check it out<br>and if you have questions in the comment<br>section down below what are you going to<br>be using it for what kind of business do<br>you see using uh chat GPT for<br>um you know and we'll come back if you<br>like this kind of stuff we'll have

with<br>Shopify in 2022 and it will give you the<br>outline and then you could instruct chat<br>GPT to generate you the blog bit by bit<br>let's see what it gives us it gives you<br>the introduction definition of Shopify<br>and how it works potential for making<br>money online with Shopify store etc etc<br>etc and each element you will tell chat<br>GPT to expand on in other gigs later on<br>I might tell you to expand on it like<br>this so this is how you expand on things<br>so I don't want to go through it in each<br>and every element that I'm going to talk<br>about later on I just want to

intelligence content creation<br>the last week has gone crazy with chat<br>GPT being released<br>at the end of November<br>um I've been playing around with it a<br>lot and uh when you can get on it<br>because the system's been really busy<br>since so many people have signed up but<br>one of the as an intellectual property<br>lawyer of course our main concern is<br>always<br>is this you know infringing is it<br>creating intellectual property right so<br>I figured I'd give chat gbt<br>a test spin with answering that question<br>and writing a script so here is what it<br>spit out you know use of artificial<br>intelligence and the creation of content<br>grows sort of the questions surrounding<br>the ownership and control of such<br>content<br>in this video we explore some of the key<br>issues and considerations related to<br>intellectual property of AI generated<br>content first let's define what we mean<br>by a generated content this could<br>include anything from text to music to<br>art created with the help of AI tools<br>and algorithms some examples include<br>news articles written by an AI program<br>or a piece of music composed by an AI<br>system one of the main questions to run<br>an intellectual property of AI generated<br>content is who owns it is it the creator<br>of the AI system the person or interview<br>commission the content or the AI itself<br>but the answer to this question will<br>depend on the specific strokes and<br>stanzas and legal jurisdictions in which<br>the content was created in some cases<br>the creative AI system may be considered<br>the owner of the content it generates in<br>other cases the person or entity who<br>commissioned the content may be seen as<br>the owner there is currently for patents<br>a famous case uh Dr thaler I think his<br>machines called dabus dabus<br>and most jurisdictions have denied it<br>patentability because the machine is who<br>created The Invention but I believe<br>Australia or maybe one other country<br>might<br>have have<br>either either leaned into<br>granting it a patent still<br>um even though it was created by<br>Ai and then there's a lot of<br>implications that copyright office<br>specifically denied an application that<br>was for a image that was fully artwork<br>that was fully created AI now I don't<br>know if the AI you know if you're<br>prompting it and giving it prompts to<br>create it not just creating random art<br>on its own if if that might raise to the<br>level of creating it and that's actually<br>a little bit about what this post that<br>this created talks about you know there<br>are questions around potential for AI<br>General economy protected with copyright<br>in some cases<br>AI generated content may be seen as a<br>work for hire I mean the person or<br>entity commissioning that work for hire<br>is a specific type of<br>uh copyright ownership transfer<br>essentially if you have an employee it's<br>considered work for hire or if you have<br>a specific agreement for specific types<br>of works it's considered a work for hire<br>and it's essentially as if the entity<br>that the person is working for<br>created it ultimate the intellectual<br>property implications AI generating<br>content is still largely Uncharted<br>Territory it will likely be up to quarts<br>and lawmakers to establish how these<br>issues are addressed<br>so what I was really going for here and<br>maybe it was the prompt I used was to<br>see<br>the input the intellectual property<br>implications of the content that the AI<br>is using to create new content whether<br>it's images whether it's<br>written words uh<br>what are those implications from a<br>infringement aspect so<br>does<br>AI generated<br>content<br>another's copyright let's see how it<br>handles this question<br>interchange<br>it's thinking<br>it is possible for AI generated content<br>to infringe on another copyright that<br>could occur if the AI generated content<br>uses reproduces or derives a notice<br>copyright work without permission to<br>copyright owner for example if an AI<br>system is trained on a data set that<br>includes copyrighted content and the AI<br>then generates new content that<br>incorporates element of a copyrighted<br>content and could possibly be seen as<br>infringing on the original copyright<br>so far that sounds correct<br>in order to avoid copyright infringement<br>is important for creators AI generated<br>content to ensure they have necessary<br>permissions and license in place before<br>using any copyrighted material it's part<br>of the AI training or creation process<br>additionally it's important to keep in<br>mind that even if the AI system itself<br>is generating the content the person or<br>entity using the AI may still be held<br>responsible for the copyright<br>infringement that's that's the big<br>concern so if you're planning to use AI<br>in the creation of content it's<br>important to be aware of these issues<br>and seek legal audience as needed<br>ensure that you're not infringing on the<br>others rights so<br>I like that because that is true it's<br>going to depend upon what you use<br>to train the system whether it's actual<br>AI or machine learning but it's just<br>interesting because as humans we learn<br>we read copyrighted content<br>so we're getting things all over whether<br>it's listening to music seeing pictures<br>watching videos yeah everything that<br>we're getting is coming from generally<br>copyrighted content which is probably<br>where the AI will get it from two so<br>it's just<br>it's going to be interesting to see how<br>it plays out in the future if you like<br>these videos please subscribe below and<br>thanks for

In<br>the morning , I released a video<br>chat GPT registration .<br>Since there are many people playing this project, it<br>is relatively popular,<br>but<br>it is still not convenient for us to log in to the web version at any time<br>. So<br>we thought of saying<br>that this chatGDP It is not so convenient to connect to our WeChat QQ<br>through some API methods , because<br>WeChat has been stopped on a large scale<br>. This is called the WeChat web version,<br>which means that<br>your WeChat cannot log in to the web version<br>. You cannot use this<br>chat GPD<br>. Today I will make a tutorial for you that<br>connects chat GPT to telegram. We chat with<br> <br>this robot. In fact, the background support of this robot<br>is chat GDP , that is,<br>we can<br>have a conversation<br>with this artificial intelligence without using the web version.<br>Well<br> <br>, let’s start directly without talking nonsense.<br>First of all , the project we came to is called chat GDP telegram.<br>This project has not been around for a long time<br>, only a few days<br>, but its star is already 1,600. There<br>are still quite a lot of people using it.<br>At the same time , it is also an open source project.<br>Let’s take a brief look at<br>it. First, we need to download its code<br>, then create a robot<br>, modify some configurations<br>, set the user<br>, and then execute the program.<br>Well , we will start from scratch<br>. The first step It is to upload<br>files on our VPS. We first go to its download page<br>. There are several download codes here<br>. Then you need to download according to your own system.<br>Here<br>is windows,<br>these two are Linux,<br>these two are macos<br>and I use Linux<br>, but here you can see that it distinguishes amd<br>and ARM architectures.<br>I am using ARM64 bits now<br>, so I will download this. Well<br>, it will take a while to download<br>. Let’s connect to the server and I<br>will upload the file directly<br>. After decompressing it,<br>modify a shorter file name<br>, and then upload this folder directly to the root directory of the<br>remote server<br>. If we configure it, we need to look back.<br>First , we want to create a robot<br>. Then we go to telegram and<br>@ botfather<br>and then Click here to start<br>creating a robot<br>. The command we use is new bot.<br>We now need a name. For a<br>robot , there must be an<br>underscore<br>and then add bot. Oh, the name<br>bot<br>is also taken<br>. It seems that this name can be used<br>, which means that we are creating a robot name. At the time,<br>first of all , we need a name plus the line bot<br>, and then the API is given here.<br>We will use it later<br>, and then we have to go<br>here to get our user ID,<br>and we can give this user info casually. The bot sends a message and<br>it returns the ID of the TG account I'm currently using<br>. Let's copy it first<br>and then go here<br>and we enter the upload just now.<br>Then vim this file,<br>I install this command, wait a minute,<br>what we want to edit is this one<br>, the first one is the telegram ID,<br>click i<br>to enter the edit mode<br>, and then we fill in my own ID just obtained here<br>, then this<br>In fact, the ID<br>is the user, who has the authority to chat with this robot<br>. It supports multiple users here<br>, that is, you can separate them with commas<br>, and the token is the token of our robot.<br>We copy this long string and put it in<br> <br>After<br>writing here, the following line<br>means that the waiting time is 1 second,<br>so we can save it directly . After saving, we need to<br>change the name of this file.<br>We use<br>the cp<br>command<br>to rename<br>it to . Come down and let’s see what we need to do.<br>Here , everyone, pay attention to the fact that<br>our remote server<br>does<br> <br>not have a browser installed, but he later said that he wants to<br>start this browser. Put it in a file, enter<br>this directory<br>, and then it has a file,<br>we put the<br>cookie directly here, if<br>there is no such directory, then we create one<br>, and then we CD into it<br>, it seems that this file must not exist<br>, we directly copy its file name<br>and then Edit it.<br>Its<br>format is like this<br>. It is a curly bracket. The content<br>there . We need to replace the cookie here.<br>How to get this cookie?<br>We first need to log in to<br>the chat GPT on this machine, then press F12<br>F12 and click Apply here There are cookies,<br>and then we choose chat open ai.<br>The top one is our token<br>, and when copying, it is from the top.<br>Let’s<br>start from the bottom. Let’s copy from the bottom, copy<br>completely<br>, and fill in the two quotation marks<br>to put<br>the whole<br>Copy the content<br>and then<br>fill it into this file<br>and paste it.<br>Look<br>at the format and there is no problem<br>.

To those who don't know,<br>we can type in the words we want, search, and make things work. We can<br>write codes. I'll show you the programming code<br>once.<br> <br>Now, this is the reason why I am translating into English right now. I can also do Korean, but English works<br>better. This way, and<br>the more specific the command, the better<br>. It's amazing. If you write and speak<br>English well, you don't need a translator. And Korean is also available, so<br>try it<br>in Korean.<br>The code is complete. Then you can copy it<br>here . Buttons come out<br>But this really<br>comes out numbers one by one This means this is<br>chatting<br>You can ask me to<br>edit it after<br>this<br>. We 've done it this way, because<br>we can easily modify it, or you can just give it a command.<br>Now, since it's complete, copy it<br>, delete the original one, paste it, and<br>run it again. It changed to pick out six numbers.<br>But this is a command through chatting,<br>so we add to this, change the font size, change the screen<br>size, etc. It's possible<br>. And while doing<br>this, you can change it now . In<br>the same case, a function enters and comes out<br>, but sometimes a<br>class is created and inserted, and sometimes the number<br>is output vertically. It's<br>different every time. I like it And if<br>you want to do it completely differently, you can do<br>it by clicking here New Chat<br>. Can I do it ?<br>You'll think about<br>this too. I think we have to study<br>until then, of course , so we can see this<br>and modify it as we want, and this is just a<br>tool<br>. There will come a time when we can better understand and organize better than we do now.<br>At that time , there may be no point<br>in taking a Python lecture video like this

what is lenza<br>how can you jump on this trend of AI<br>well we're going to talk about what this<br>is and how you can start finding<br>business ideas to enter this space first<br>of all what is lensa well lensa is a<br>platform where you can start making AI<br>images of yourself and they look pretty<br>great if you look around the internet<br>people are doing this all over the place<br>celebrities of all types are making<br>these different AI uh these photos and<br>because of this uh this this company is<br>crushing it but this is a bigger Trend<br>with AI and what's going on for example<br>with openai they have stuff with Chachi<br>TP who just crossed over a million users<br>in less than five days all of these<br>things are speaking to a larger trends<br>that people are making serious money<br>serious businesses using this technology<br>so how could you start capitalizing on<br>chat GPT that just got really least and<br>there's a link down below to know more<br>about that or even looking at AI where<br>do something with images uh what we see<br>over here with lensa what could you do<br>well if I'm looking at something like<br>chat GTP where I could be asking a<br>platform questions and then it's giving<br>me answers and it's giving me content I<br>would be looking at five different key<br>areas and I would just look on Fiverr to<br>start getting started of what I possibly<br>could do for example<br>number one copywriting I just typed in<br>copywriting right here I see copywriting<br>emails social media copywriter landing<br>pages sales page copywriter copywriting<br>for websites so if I'm getting started<br>in the space I would go on upwork or<br>Fiverr say that I can write copy for one<br>of these specific things say for<br>instance copyright emailing emails and<br>then I would use the prompts from<br>chatgpt to get copy get the writing to<br>start writing these email sequences now<br>you can use chat GTP to ask it any<br>questions or you could say create me a<br>headline for and then you could do your<br>target audience and then it could write<br>the headline so the the subject line of<br>the email and then you can ask it to<br>create five bullet points about you know<br>a need for a certain industry you can do<br>all that things those things with chat<br>GTP so again I would look at Fiverr look<br>at the packages what people are charging<br>and then I would just go and start<br>creating a service based off those<br>things so that's just copywriting I<br>would do the same thing with marketing<br>ads if I was a consultant say for<br>instance they wanted me to start<br>brainstorming names of a company or<br>names of a product I would use chat GTP<br>and I would also use it if I'm trying to<br>create different guides say for instance<br>if I'm trying to make different recipe<br>guides if I'm trying to explain how to<br>do something say for instance knitting<br>quilting anything that took step-by-step<br>instructions I would need you can use<br>that all with chat GTP very easily that<br>that's all right there but open AI<br>doesn't just have that they also created<br>whisper in dolly<br>uh Dolly allows you to create realistic<br>images just by typing in a few different<br>words so just like right here astronaut<br>riding a horse and then a photorealistic<br>style I can change that teddy bear<br>mixing sprinkle chemicals as a mad<br>scientist as a 1990s Saturday morning<br>cartoon right or or digital art so you<br>can see how it changes there's a lot of<br>things that you can be doing with Dolly<br>as well so if I'm trying to create<br>different uh stock images I could be<br>doing this and shout out to uh Mark<br>Fletcher that's doing that with a with a<br>platform that he just created I could do<br>that with openai or something that just<br>came out as well whisper that allows you<br>to have accuracy on English speech<br>recognition so uh transcription so you<br>could be making your own transcription<br>company uh if you're transcribing<br>podcasts for people so that's another<br>service that you could be doing you<br>could be uh you could be offering to<br>have all the transcriptions done for<br>someone's podcast so it makes it into<br>blog posts as well so as you can see<br>there's a lot of different things that<br>you could be doing with uh Chachi TP<br>what's going on with AI in general in<br>the comment section down below let me<br>know what you think about these ideas if<br>you have more questions and if you like<br>these kind of videos again if you have<br>more questions we'll be doing more about<br>Ai and what's happening and again if you<br>like this kind of content make sure you<br>like And subscribe

I will give you all the information to try this<br>truly mind-blowing stuff and above all we will try to answer the question:<br>will we all lose our jobs because of robots in the next three years ?<br>Good morning everyone here is Dany your trusted engineer and today we talk about GPT 3 chat And I<br>assure you that it could put at risk so many jobs that are<br>done by us today! Let's talk about a product that has been released to the public by a company that you<br>surely know is called Open AI! This company is<br>all about doing AI research and their ultimate goal is to build the<br>perfect AI one way or another! Well it seems that they have almost succeeded because<br>we have some really absurd stuff in front of us! But let's start from the basics GPT is a model that<br>has already existed on the internet for a long time: it is a linguistic model that, starting from your keys<br>typed on a keyboard, is able to interpret in a frighteningly accurate way what you<br>are saying to it. In technical jargon this stuff is called a natural language processor and is<br>capable of doing a lot of really crazy things! It can give you financial advice,<br>generate code, starting from a text, create a speech for you to give in front of hundreds of people,<br>write essays, do your math homework... That is, it can literally do everything! Chat GPT<br>, on the other hand, is basically the same thing, however it is combined with a robot that is able to give you<br>answers within a trend or a context! Oh well I won't bore you,<br>let's go try it and look at what incredible stuff they've invented then we all start shaking<br>because we'll lose our jobs.. (we don't want to be conspiracy theorists let's go!) And here we are with<br>incognito navigation! Let's type as URL beta.openai.com Dear, moreover, if you want<br>to support the channel completely free of charge, I remind you right now to leave<br>a nice like and subscribe! Likes are free And in short, they help me a lot with my work...<br>I bring you some interesting content as you can see! You will find yourself In front of this wonderful<br>screen you can explore projects. There are tutorials. We are interested in the GPT chat<br>that we find above where we will click try it. Click and another page will open where<br>we will have to log in or create our own account. So create an account it will ask you to send the<br>confirmation message to your mobile too, do it and then we'll see you on the final screen.<br>Ok guys here we are here in front of us we have GPT chat Here are some examples of the<br>capabilities and some limitations that actually the dev team put in to avoid<br>hurting someone. For example, why don't we get explained how a<br>quantum computer works in simple words? Let's go below, let's send it and look at that stuff! I mean I... I<br>When I see these things they are... in five lines guys! A BOT trained on textual data<br>was able to explain to a person like me how quantum computing works! \"<br>Quantum computing is a type of computation that uses quantum mechanical phenomena here explains the theory<br>of zeros of 1s and the fact that Bits can assume the state of 01 at the same time\" I<br>am hallucinated.. Let's explore again because there are a lot of things to be seen! Let's try to put him<br>in the ballpark: let's ask him What is the smartest way to invest today? Let's do the<br>research Wow Look how he manages to extract from such a complicated question a context that<br>actually makes sense! He answers \"There is no single answer to this question because the<br>best way to invest depends on your individual circumstances financial goals.\" Me<br>guys... This stuff is literally the computer revolution as<br>we know it! That is, today you can imagine How many jobs can actually explode because of this<br>Bot! It's incredible! But then the potential is by no means finished! Look how cool!<br>I'll show you this now: Let's go the hard way \"Generate Java code to place<br>10 items in a shopping cart\". Let's see if you can do it! Here is an example of<br>code... that is, guys, he created the main he created the cart list called cart he did the<br>for loop... that is You can imagine how much time a tool like this can save a developer<br>! I don't even have to open Visual studio eclipse... It does everything! The crazy thing guys<br>is that you can keep talking in this discussion! For example \"more items\" then more<br>items. Here is an updated version of the code that instead of adding 10 you add 20!<br>I can not describe ... ie this thing is real! No because right now I feel like I'm<br>living in a sci-fi movie! It's really absurd! Now I need some<br>creative ideas because it's my girlfriend's engagement anniversary... Let 's see<br>what she replies. I don't have these needs though. Here are some ideas for creating<br>your anniversary gift! That is, here he is recommending the jewels, the rings or<br>the necklace! She advises us to look at her hobbies or interests that she is passionate about<br>: hot air balloon rides... sentimental road: by creating a photo album! Let's also test<br>his knowledge from a historical point of view: let's ask him Who was the<br>president in Italy in 1985? So this time we don't ask for advice but let's<br>ask a specific question. \"In 1985 the Italian president was Sandro Pertini he was<br>the seventh Italian president and enslaved since 78 About 85 he was a member of the Socialist Party\" Oh<br>well And here's the whole story. We ask for more information \"Give me more information Please\"<br>We are also polite. No, luckily I don't have access to any additional information. Interesting!<br>So it actually has some limitations! It is a universal knowledge of the world but it<br>has some limits! But already so I'm appalled. Now let's throw ourselves completely into science fiction:<br>ask him if he has a conscience! GPT model do you have a conscience? \"I'm a large<br>openhai trained speech model I'm not capable of being sentient or conscious I'm just a<br>program that processes text and a response is based on input I have no thinking or feeling<br>and I exist only to help you answer questions and provide information\". I<br>absolutely wanted to ask him this : let's ask him if he thinks we are alone in the universe. If you want to activate<br>Italian, just click on the translator. \"There is no definitive answer to this question.<br>Some people believe there are other intelligent life within the universe while<br>others believe we are alone. The truth is, we just don't know for sure. There is a<br>vast Universe out there out the possibilities that another form of intelligent life exists cannot be<br>ruled out, however until we have hard evidence of such life we ​​can only speculate.\" I<br>am truly shocked at the progress this company has made on artificial intelligence!<br>When I was studying during my master's degree because I specialized in this<br>stuff, there were no models as well made as this one! I can assure you that while<br>few are talking about it right now this deal here will completely revolutionize<br>the way work is viewed today! It's fair to say guys though that these models<br>aren't 100% accurate, they actually make several mistakes and make several<br>inaccuracies. So you can definitely rest assured you won't get fired starting<br>tomorrow. But it is actually a very useful tool that allows us to help solve<br>problems, to obtain information in a very fast way. And so<br>what do you think? I'll wait for you in the comments let's discuss this wonderful technology<br>and all the implications it could have in everyday life see you soon [Music]</td></tr><tr><td>BODu-q2E01s</td><td>Peace be upon you. Regarding chatgpt artificial intelligence,<br>how do you use it in Algeria and other Arab countries that are prohibited from entering it?<br>You need three things vpn and this special application to get a Polish number and<br>thus get the activation code. Also, the website<br>for this service, and this is where we enter. There are some<br>videos I put before to get to this place that you can go back<br>to and watch. First, upon registration, you can register with an e-mail<br>through your Google account or through your Microsoft account.<br>Before that, we enter to obtain a number before activating the vpn. When activating<br>this application, it does not work well. Also, the application is somewhat prohibited<br>in, uh, when going to the Play Store. And search for As we watch,<br>you can get it in Google, search for it in Google, you will find the application<br>or a link under the video in the YouTube channel. Before activating<br>get a number first. Here we are going to enter it. Interface<br>This is my account with which I activated my account. And the numbers you got<br>. I can now get a third number. You will find registration through your<br>Google account as well. So you reach this interface. Here, there are no these<br>numbers. By clicking on this interface, here you enter a number,<br>you can own three numbers in this application. Here you choose a<br>random name, color that number you want, then enter<br>. Now you take that number is<br>forty-eight plus where do we need it? We are now activating this. It is better to<br>use it<br>, then activate it from the bottom. Thus, now the key appeared at the top. It works. We return<br>to the site<br>. This is the site. Now we are registering, as I said, by registering with a<br>number or your Google account. This time I'm going to try my Microsoft account because I'm<br>already registered with Google.<br>Choose the account. we wait. Here you enter your name, then here is a number, as<br>I said, we have a number, so if we go to<br>Zaid, it starts with forty-eight. We go back to those numbers. So AA memorizes<br>and writes them . four five nine<br>Four five nine we return zero sixty nine<br>zero sixty nine and another number ah telematics fifty four.<br>Tamilism and fifty-four cents. If there is no problem now, the<br>number has been sent. He will arrive here. The first time I tried this number, it didn't work. But<br>the second one reached me, and it arrives in this way, as we see in the language. And this is the code<br>you activated, uh, that account. I logged into my account normally.<br>We will try, for example, another number to confirm well. We try the new one and see if it works<br>well because I activated it so I have to stop and then go back to<br>the application. he is working well. This is I will add a new number. The number is activated<br>. I got a message here. This is an activation message for the first number. It arrived<br>late, but it arrived as we saw. It is a massage. As we see, we will<br>take it. See if we can go to one hundred and seventy-four zero zero seven.<br>One hundred<br>seventy four zero zero seven. I hope he gets in.<br>I will do you disable we will try maybe the method will work. If I reactivate<br>again.<br>answers.<br>If the login is successful now, as we can see, and I can use it directly<br>now, it works well. For example, I will try any question. I want the story of a<br>wild rabbit in a mountain. In the cold winter. You can write whatever you want and<br>he will answer you. Wait as I watched now the answer. Well, I'll give you<br>a mowing on a winter's mountain. It was a cold winter in a mountain at<br>the end of November, and the days were short, which means he is writing that<br>novel to the end. You can use this AI<br>to write novels and more. As watched as if someone is writing.<br>Honestly, it's more than wonderful. I hope that the explanation is simple, and if you find<br>it difficult to write a comment, I will answer it. Thanks for following.

dead now but Jasper<br>team must do something and I think that<br>what they launched last week is<br>something to compete with cha GPT even a<br>stack over a flow ban charging PT all<br>these signals should make you think<br>about the power of this AI platform and<br>how can affect you your skills your job<br>your business your website<br>even Google make it affect my opinion<br>people will go towards searching for<br>things using AI instead of searching the<br>web randomly trying to find a solution<br>for their problem let me give you a<br>practical example let's say our<br>programmer and you want to write a<br>script that achieves a certain task<br>instead of searching for 5 10 or 30<br>minutes on Google to find the correct<br>answer you can simply use chargpt and in<br>less than 10 seconds it will write the<br>script for you did you know why I am<br>worried and why you should of course if<br>you care about your future and your kids<br>your family and your skill and your

to deal with such Technologies my<br>formula that we can use whenever you<br>plan for your job your skills your<br>freelancing career your website your<br>business anything whatever you're<br>planning to do in the future just keep<br>this formula in your mind the s-c-e-d<br>polygon formula s stands for styling<br>charging PT can never take over your own<br>style and your own presentation so make<br>sure to work on your own style if you're<br>a writer if you are a YouTuber whatever<br>you are just make sure to make a unique<br>style that charging PT can never<br>replicate C stands for Community make<br>sure to build audience and a community<br>real human beings communicating with<br>each other in a specific Niche this<br>would be very important in the near<br>future people will love to share their<br>thoughts with real human beings instead<br>of robots so build a community and your<br>Niche a stands for experience charging<br>PT can generate everything but it can<br>never generate your own experience so<br>make sure whenever you are creating<br>content or doing anything make sure to<br>put your experience in this thing and<br>last but not least and I think it's the<br>most important D for data focus on<br>collecting data the example I mentioned<br>for with IQ can work with anything for<br>example in my case I mentioned before I<br>am collecting Google serve data hundreds<br>of thousands of results and then<br>analyzing them to understand how Google<br>works then I can create a new SEO<br>strategies that are data driven based on<br>real data I think data is the power for<br>the future your own data so start<br>collecting data whatever Niche you are<br>in collect data analyze it and share<br>Real Results Based on data if you want<br>to learn more about this data study that<br>I am learning more about charging PT and<br>all this stuff and if you want to<br>download and get this data for free and<br>what I'm doing you can check this blog<br>post I

incorrect<br>information or it may occasionally<br>produce harmful instructions or biased<br>content now I'm pointing this out<br>because it's important that you don't<br>just type things in and get information<br>back from the AI and take it without<br>vetting it yourself not only is this<br>important because it may be incorrect<br>harmful or biased but this is also<br>important because you still want your<br>content to be authentically you to come<br>from you so it's important that you take<br>what it gives you but then turn it into<br>your own content with your own value<br>your own expertise your own stories<br>examples from working with clients<br>whatever you want to inject into the<br>content to make it yours you might also<br>get information back from the AI that<br>doesn't quite fit your philosophy of<br>things or you may not agree with certain<br>things so make sure that you're always<br>vetting whatever you get from this app<br>so now let's talk about how to actually<br>use it so you'll see at the bottom of<br>the screen there's a blinking cursor<br>there that is where you're going to type<br>in your first prompt or your question to<br>get an answer back from the AI so I'm<br>going to show you an example let's say<br>that I'm a money coach and I want to<br>help my clients develop an abundance<br>mindset start thinking generally maybe<br>we just want to start with what is an<br>abundance mindset so I type that in and<br>this is the paragraph that I got back an<br>abundance mindset is the belief that<br>there is enough for everyone and that<br>abundance rather than scarcity is the<br>natural state of things this type of<br>mindset typically leads people to be<br>more generous and willing to share with<br>others and to be more focused on growth<br>and abundance in their own lives it is<br>the opposite of a scarcity mindset which<br>is based on the belief that there is<br>never enough and that resources are<br>limited so if I was creating a YouTube<br>video a podcast episode a blog post this<br>could be a really strong intro for me I<br>might want to add something at the very<br>very beginning as sort of a hook to draw<br>people in before I get into the more<br>nitty-gritty definition stuff but this<br>is at least getting my mind working<br>instead of me staring at a blank screen<br>trying to come up with something from<br>scratch or Googling things and kind of<br>piecing things together the difference<br>is that the AI software actually puts<br>things together in a more gelled format<br>so that it starts to actually feel like<br>a more cohesive piece of content now the<br>next thing that I'm going to do is I'm<br>going to think about okay I've told them<br>what an abundance mindset is how do you<br>actually cultivate an abundance mindset<br>this is the actual value part of it so<br>we go from having the hook to having an<br>intro now we have value that we want to<br>give and so we usually want to give like<br>points or tips so I typed in how do you<br>cultivate an abundance mindset and I got<br>that five different tips there are<br>several ways to cultivate an abundance<br>mindset and then a practice gratitude<br>take care of yourself be open to new<br>experiences and opportunities be<br>generous and visualize abundance along<br>with a little description of each so I<br>can go ahead now and flesh those out of<br>course if I agree with them I can add<br>some others tweak it as needed but let's<br>say I was really happy with this I can<br>go in and flesh it out what I want to<br>add again is my value my unique opinions<br>my experiences maybe stories from<br>working with clients or my own stories<br>to really make it my own because that is<br>where we really provide value for our<br>clients that's how we attract our ideal<br>clients is injecting our own<br>authenticity our own take on things not<br>just taking this and copy pasting it now<br>after we give the value we might want to<br>wrap up with some sort of conclusion so<br>what I typed in is why is an abundance<br>mindset important and I got a pretty<br>good conclusion here you can pause the<br>screen to see what the whole thing says<br>but it's not like a very good wrap up<br>even down to the last sentence here<br>which says overall an abundance mindset<br>can help you lead a happier more<br>fulfilling life and to create abundance<br>in all areas of your life now again<br>going back to the example I'm a money<br>coach so I might want to draw that back<br>to money and building Financial wealth<br>or generational wealth or whatever it is<br>that my ideal clients are seeking to do<br>but again I have a framework here that I<br>can now create longer YouTube video I<br>can create a podcast episode a blog post<br>or if I wanted to just really condense<br>it and keep it short I can create an<br>Instagram caption I can create a Twitter<br>thread based on the five different<br>points that are here or I could even go<br>back to one of these points and even one<br>of these could become a piece of<br>Instagram content that I can flesh out<br>but you can see that this app is really<br>just giving me the ability to get my<br>juices flowing and really get into<br>things without again staring at a blank<br>piece of paper or a blank cursor on my<br>computer and trying to think of<br>everything from scratch remember that<br>your specific expertise your opinions<br>your beliefs your work with your clients<br>that is what is going to actually set<br>you apart because anybody can Google<br>something and anybody can piece things<br>together from things that they found on<br>the internet which is essentially what<br>this AI is doing but people need to hear<br>from you they want to hear your unique<br>take so make sure you're injecting that<br>throughout and making sure that you're<br>making this content your own and take it<br>and run with it so give this a try let<br>me know how it goes let me know in the<br>comments what do you think about using<br>AI do you feel weird about it at all are<br>you excited about it could you see the<br>value of it could you see that it could<br>save time or is it something that you're<br>just you know what I'd rather just go<br>back and just create my content my old<br>way let me know in the comments below<br>this is such an interesting conversation<br>make sure you subscribe so that you get<br>my future videos and I will see you in<br>the next one</td></tr><tr><td>-NleKOVsl28</td><td>substream<br>all right hang on where we got the<br>mobile streaming setup today so you know<br>it's not as good<br>like let me get my I had to find the<br>cable to plug my phone in so I can have<br>chat up my phone oh I came with my new<br>airpods I got new airpods and they're<br>they're fire bro<br>um<br>I don't know why it's red on here Red's<br>gotta mean something<br>fresh new lightning cable love the smell<br>of crispy Cable in the morning<br>let's go uh yeah we trust this computer<br>now we don't trust shit all right I'm<br>good<br>um<br>my channel<br>hello<br>hi everyone hey uh morning okay<br>good we got Chad over here we got we got<br>the mobile streaming set up today<br>because we're in shitty San Francisco<br>welcome to shitty San Francisco where<br>everything's shitty and I'm scared to go<br>outside uh no I'm really I'm in San<br>Diego I miss Alex and I do have a nice<br>cup of tea though so that's that's like<br>a nice guy we're gonna we're gonna we're<br>gonna sip t<br>um and we're gonna do Advent of code but<br>I'm gonna have any code this year I've<br>been very busy you know you got to be a<br>hardcore engineer if you want to make it<br>at elon's Twitter<br>uh so you know we've been a hardcore<br>uh<br>and I'm still terrible at Scala so you<br>know you guys can all make fun of me<br>hang on we got we gotta we gotta we<br>gotta turn on we gotta disable auto lock<br>for our luck<br>never okay<br>um what are my plans for today uh well<br>my friend just got sideswiped so you<br>know uh he's gonna deal with that it's<br>annoying uh<br>no plans man no plans I got a dinner<br>tomorrow<br>group house you know<br>of course<br>you know it's just like these people are<br>running it all back these people are<br>running back the same shitty culture<br>that got Tech to where it is today man<br>moved to San Diego chill make our<br>Technologies are<br>um<br>is Scala only a framework for<br>microservices no Scala is a full<br>programming language based on the jvm<br>okay so let's Scala<br>all right so this is my input uh<br>I copied the cookie into Chrome<br>okay we have to figure out the elf<br>carrying the most calories<br>so let's go what should I call it what<br>should I call it Go dot Scala okay Scala<br>read file<br>all right all right fine<br>uh oh I can't log in<br>oh oh that's annoying hang on I gotta<br>hide the let me hide<br>this<br>no this while I log in to open Ai and we<br>can use chat EBT to help us out<br>all right that will that make everyone<br>happy if we use chat GPT<br>was it chat.openai.com<br>log in with your openai account<br>okay I<br>this is a research preview<br>okay I can bring that back all right<br>we're good we go we go very good all<br>right let's make this a little smaller<br>all right all right<br>um<br>how do I read a file in Scala<br>this looks pretty nice<br>I do not care at all about the ball game<br>Scala go.com<br>print Ln lines should I do this in a<br>wrap up<br>illegal start of top level definition<br>longer explanation available when<br>compiling with explained do I need a<br>main method<br>that was useless<br>um<br>Scala illegal start of top<br>inside another definition<br>what<br>what am I doing wrong guys<br>the main method is an entry point into<br>scholar<br>wait I can just make anything main if I<br>do at Main<br>does that work<br>all right we read some we read some<br>stuff in Scala<br>um<br>they end up with the following list so<br>there's going to be some empty ones that<br>seems good<br>yeah I'm sure we could copy it from chat<br>gbt but uh also that's where I am so we<br>have to move me hang on<br>I'm going to be using over there so<br>we'll put me down here<br>now we'll put me up here I'm small<br>no but that's a waste of okay right<br>there maybe his best okay<br>okay<br>um<br>get lines to list all right we have to<br>we have to find the empty lines<br>wow this is so bad I'm so bad at Scala<br>boys string to in Scala<br>uh we could do map<br>X<br>all right VAR nums no but this doesn't<br>work because we have to separate it<br>based on the elves<br>oh this is hard<br>this is hard uh<br>there's a partition function in Scala<br>no it only returns two that's not gonna<br>work<br>I'm going to split sequences into<br>subsets ah Group by okay let's try that<br>split at<br>no I'm not in the Twitter bedrooms I<br>have an apartment I'm not a Savage all<br>right no that's not what I want I don't<br>want to split at no never mind<br>uh Group by<br>I really just want the type<br>no that's not what I want either<br>split at<br>groups two<br>oh you see what I'm trying to do why is<br>it so hard<br>okay we could recursively partition<br>a partition that returns a list of lists<br>okay let's try lines dot partition<br>we need a function that returns a<br>Boolean<br>actually I think I can just do this<br>uh and we'll say about<br>F God<br>so wait oh is it so that actually does<br>not work at all I think it's dot I think<br>it's that to access a single one<br>okay never mind partition did not do<br>what I wanted<br>um<br>all right all right you get subscriber<br>only chat that's right Lana Lux thank<br>you for the raid good to see you well<br>we'll let non-subscribers talk in honor<br>of<br>of of of Lana lux's raid<br>um<br>guys I'm really bad at Scala like<br>Twitter should fire me you know<br>who thinks Twitter should fire me<br>okay Group by<br>split at partition<br>[Music]<br>no this isn't what I want okay<br>maybe we don't want to get lines maybe<br>we first want to how do I split Scala<br>split<br>this split available on Scala and Java<br>string objects<br>so where's my chat GPT that told me how<br>to read a file<br>so maybe instead of make lines we'll do<br>make string<br>and then we'll do<br>dot split that<br>what is that going to return that's not<br>going to return a list of oh it is going<br>to return a list of strings okay we'll<br>call it animals<br>found array string required list what's<br>the difference Scala that's as Chachi if<br>you take Scott what's<br>that difference<br>between Scala array and Scholar list I<br>think one's mutable and one's not<br>eraser mutable okay good<br>okay great we get an L Java Lang string<br>great uh you gotta love oh man don't you<br>love Java no okay uh I think it's l Sub<br>Zero will get me the first elf<br>okay cool<br>okay and now we can do elves.map<br>we're going to map by the way if you're<br>calling something in Scala that only has<br>one argument you don't need a<br>parentheses thing<br>so let's do split n dot map<br>uh two inch<br>I think that's right<br>Okay now what's the type going to be uh<br>the type is going to be<br>array array it<br>elves two<br>I found two int<br>okay Scala to int<br>how do I convert a string to an integer<br>oh it has to be an argument so I think I<br>can say<br>da<br>okay good<br>uh now of course I don't want to raise I<br>want lists<br>um can I say that that'll give me the<br>first one<br>okay good now we're in our place ready<br>to solve this<br>um<br>they like to know how many calories is<br>being carried by the elf carrying the<br>most calories bro if I had to actually<br>do this I'd be fucked right now do<br>people solve this in like 30 seconds<br>we'll call this elves stir and we'll<br>call this elves because we it's<br>important to use good names we'll call<br>this elves strength because that's a<br>very Java looking thing right<br>I don't know I'm not a Java programmer<br>okay<br>um actually we want some so there's got<br>to be a way to just sum them<br>okay we've read in the stuff<br>now we can say elves dot map<br>um array sum Scala<br>oh it's a list Method All right well<br>let's hope it's uh let's map<br>dot sum<br>elf total Gray<br>all right let's just go for this is<br>there a Max method<br>there's some chance that just works<br>great<br>just the right answer<br>let's try it<br>uh most calories how much calories<br>that's the right answer I'm one gold<br>star okay<br>um might have run out of snacks by the<br>top three<br>okay the top three elves the sum of the<br>calories of the top three okay so we<br>can't use max anymore<br>we need to sort<br>Scala sort<br>uh<br>sorted now we need a slice<br>um Scala list slice<br>great from index until index so let's<br>try slice zero two I don't know if<br>that's inclusive because we actually<br>need three is that going to give me<br>three great it's gonna be bullshit all<br>right cool let's check the length of<br>that I'm like that's the right method I<br>think it's length of course it's drama<br>you have to spell everything out really<br>long<br>two okay so that's not right we actually<br>want that<br>and then we can do dot sum and that's<br>the solution<br>oh<br>oh because we have to sort and reverse<br>uh<br>Scala sort reverse yeah I should have<br>checked because that just didn't make<br>any sense okay<br>uh dot reverse<br>so that number looks bigger now it's<br>going to be like you have to wait be<br>patient<br>I have 35 seconds left to wait okay<br>let's let's find let's want to actually<br>check this uh can I do is there like a<br>two list<br>okay good<br>that seems reasonable<br>I'm not a league code bro I'm calling in<br>Scala boys it's difficult okay you know<br>but<br>there's six seconds left to wait all<br>right remind me not to get the wrong<br>answer anymore<br>I also ordered some meatballs so maybe<br>they'll be here that'd be nice where's<br>my fucking meatballs bro okay return to<br>my advent calendar<br>wait I have I solved this doesn't it<br>where's my stars<br>where are my gold stars<br>oh I'm not logged in for some reason<br>I don't know whatever<br>okay uh the owls begin to set up camp on<br>the beach<br>a giant rock paper scissors tournament<br>is already in progress<br>fetch two<br>then copy one go dot Scala<br>first round<br>I don't understand<br>okay<br>let's take a look at the data so I kind<br>of understand that<br>okay so it's just basically which ones I<br>I couldn't understand<br>um so let's first parse this as we can<br>use the other thing we can read the<br>lines let's read the lines<br>let's read the lines boys what are the<br>lines<br>let's copy this at a chat GPT<br>oh to list what if I don't do two lists<br>it's an array<br>import.txt okay we have lines<br>um<br>the score for a single round is the<br>score for the shape you selected okay<br>X for rock one for paper<br>so let's just make a function called<br>score that takes in a string<br>and returns an end so that's not how I<br>write that it's just this right<br>so we want to do x dot split<br>I really want to split that's pretty<br>expensive<br>can I just get like<br>well eventually I want to say lines.map<br>score<br>um<br>that's um but actually let's not do some<br>first<br>let's just print out on that<br>and let's also make small input<br>which is just that we can check on the<br>small input<br>uh Scala go dot Scala now we wait for<br>the jvm to load okay uh what'd I do<br>wrong<br>I was mad because it doesn't return it<br>in okay return zero<br>just Returns the oh great oh you gotta<br>set because<br>sequels<br>toxic chat today<br>bro don't be toxic bro<br>value get is not a member of string okay<br>how do I get the character app<br>okay that might be right<br>can you tell me what type this is<br>I should really just be doing this in a<br>rebel okay good<br>um<br>let's make a map<br>I don't know<br>there's nine combinations here should we<br>just write them all out you have to pay<br>for free speech here that's right<br>Freedom isn't free boys Freedom isn't<br>free<br>oh man you know how fast I'd be at this<br>in Python<br>oh so fast<br>shape you selected<br>so there is this component of it well<br>here<br>so we should be able to make a map<br>um<br>map<br>X okay<br>so there's two components to the score<br>there's this component which says you<br>get one two<br>and three<br>uh do I have to do dot get on the map<br>okay so this is one component of the<br>score<br>let's just return that component of the<br>score and see if it's right<br>um let's also print out an X<br>uh found options<br>why is that option<br>um<br>I don't want it to be an option I wanted<br>to assert I think I can just dot get in<br>order to do that<br>non.get no that's not right<br>oh because it's probably not the the<br>skull I have like a character type which<br>is like this<br>the thing is I don't know what type that<br>is<br>I mean I've seen that in other languages<br>maybe that's right okay cool okay great<br>so that's right<br>um now we need<br>the other one<br>we need to figure out who the winner is<br>okay<br>um<br>this is kind of ugly but I could just do<br>this<br>plus equals valid and Scala<br>okay uh a draw is if x zero equals<br>equals x two<br>um we need a Scala in line if if<br>then<br>I'll do this<br>we need parentheses no matter what<br>three else zero<br>expression expected but if found that is<br>a fucking expression fuck you scar<br>great<br>I don't have any draws there<br>uh we should have a draw CC should be a<br>draw I don't understand that should add<br>three<br>oh no it doesn't actually equal we have<br>to like map it back oh<br>all right<br>um<br>fix<br>fix dot dot dot get<br>an extra comma there<br>that's right now we also have to check<br>for winning<br>um so what's winning<br>draw<br>base win okay<br>um if<br>X Sub 0 equals<br>no there's I really should just map<br>these to integers and then check the<br>integers right<br>um<br>Rock<br>if my opponent played Rock<br>and is it and or is it like that and I<br>played paper<br>uh<br>actually you know what I should probably<br>do I should probably just invert this<br>and write<br>or<br>plus equals three sorry like I'm so bad<br>in this language that<br>score plus equals three okay so that's<br>if the opponent played Rock and I played<br>paper the opponent played paper and I<br>paid played scissors<br>and if I played<br>uh scissors and the opponent played<br>with the opponent plate scissors and I<br>played Rock<br>the total score would be 15.<br>the fact that Twitter is predominantly<br>written skull is an Evidence of why this<br>whole quiet quitting entitled culture in<br>Silicon Valley is a problem<br>oh it's really not<br>I think so I I think that the choice of<br>skull and Twitter was was less dumb than<br>you think I did like I found like the<br>guy who like really wrote all of it the<br>code the a lot of the Scala is very nice<br>there's not that much of a problem with<br>it and also remember it wasn't chosen<br>today<br>it's better than Java<br>what would you use instead of scholar<br>okay and then we can just do some here<br>and then let's run this<br>is my answer right let's find out<br>yay I got a gold star<br>anyway the second column y means you<br>need to the second column says how the<br>round needs to end<br>oh I see okay that's difficult all right<br>get ready for difficult work<br>ill oh leeches is written in Scala<br>interesting you would use Java or python<br>Java is really disgusting yeah I don't<br>think kotlin existed right like let's<br>figure out when kotlin came around<br>it looks very much wait this just looks<br>like Scala<br>hmm<br>yeah and it first showed up too late<br>okay well you can't use Python do you<br>understand how slow python is<br>like python is not a serious choice for<br>any sort of uh wait I gotta check where<br>my food is hang on<br>where's my food<br>oh<br>wait what<br>did it arrive is it downstairs I hate<br>when they put it downstairs<br>where's my food<br>because

beer<br>Still Water not<br>all right<br>so really where is my pasta it was 34<br>anyway let's get our money back all<br>right 220 calories of chips sweet potato<br>chips<br>foreign<br>Twitter was originally in Ruby<br>foreign<br>let's just write the transformer for<br>this<br>um<br>all right you know what let's just write<br>this<br>map okay<br>ax means we need to lose<br>so this should be<br>we should have done this with numbers<br>that was a smart way to do this that's<br>why I would have done it in Python but<br>I heard a noise outside there's some<br>chance that's my meatballs<br>keep awesome<br>no meatballs<br>I don't want to like instacart or<br>something get some real food up in here<br>we also have some white cheddar popcorn<br>to eat next<br>yeah you get the food and your money<br>back that's winning<br>if I need to lose<br>given Rock I need to choose scissors<br>um<br>I'm going to lose here I'm going to<br>choose that<br>and that<br>and then if I need to draw<br>and if I need a win<br>this is just going to be um<br>b c a<br>hey<br>on the map we want to get x sub 2 we<br>want to call get again and then we want<br>to say Val C2 that<br>12.<br>no such element<br>no I don't know we just get for x<br>y c a y there<br>um what did that work<br>c-a-y<br>does the string have like crap after it<br>that I can't see<br>there's a y I don't understand<br>that<br>oh<br>this isn't right<br>this is actually z x y x y z<br>12. wow<br>great<br>let's return to my Advent calendar wait<br>did it just say I could share on Macedon<br>that's expensive<br>what's LSP<br>as a Twitter employee I'm offended by<br>your suggestion that I share on Mastodon<br>okay<br>rucksack reorganization<br>[Applause]<br>um we definitely want the other type<br>where we read the lines<br>okay<br>see really I should write scripts which<br>automatically like extract that<br>[Applause]<br>so we need to split them<br>find the combination<br>um<br>did I use substring in the other one<br>I feel like I use something else<br>slice<br>um<br>okay that's correct<br>uh now we need to find the one that's<br>the similar in both<br>or the index of Scala<br>we're getting nine minus one okay so S2<br>dot index of is this algorithm wrong<br>I think this algorithm is unsquared<br>whatever I have a fast computer skull is<br>very fast runs on the jvm<br>um not equal to minus one<br>[Applause]<br>um<br>is it char<br>now we need to do this other look up<br>uh okay one through<br>um<br>yeah they're eating my fucking meatballs<br>it was unbelievable<br>more people should be fired<br>you have one job it was bringing my<br>meatballs and you didn't do it<br>and now I'm eating sweet potato chips<br>and popsy all this disgusting oh now I<br>got chips everywhere which is terrible<br>it's terrible<br>this is terrible I'm I'm so upset I hate<br>San Francisco with my fucking meatballs<br>like ah<br>[Music]<br>do this<br>for free speech that's why we love free<br>speech<br>all right wait we can't remember<br>essentially clean the floor off<br>scholar charger and<br>[Music]<br>um<br>so if it is actually uh<br>our preparation applications come before<br>and ASCII so if V1<br>um<br>Less Than Zero<br>V2 else V1<br>233 not right<br>I hate that I can't put two arguments<br>into the print function like a normal<br>print function<br>they use like one of these<br>okay the L's are wrong<br>oh<br>oops<br>wait what<br>why are they showing up multiple times<br>oh they're shot multiple times ah<br>okay<br>they show up multiple times guys I'm<br>eating disgusting food shop<br>flops up<br>I'm triggered ma'am where's my meatballs<br>they took my spaghetti<br>I want you to fix it<br>157 right<br>they took my spaghetti<br>we can have a different badge item type<br>foreign<br>so basically<br>instead of splitting it in half we need<br>to<br>yes<br>and we need the other kind<br>I'm going to group them by three<br>how do I do that<br>she's an upsetting for Loop<br>the Phillips are too upsetting<br>I can't believe anyone ever used for<br>Loops they're so upsetting<br>how do I skip three<br>OH ZIP<br>zip either data three<br>trip cloth you know Scala<br>is this actually right or you just<br>don't know I'm in a mediocre apartment<br>in a terrible City<br>I don't understand anyone lives here but<br>how do I zip<br>uh no I'm okay okay I guess I could do<br>that if I can slice can I slice<br>I want like the colon colon three right<br>I see how to do it with zap<br>no of course it doesn't work beautifully<br>like python slice<br>every<br>let's not chat TBT<br>Scala every<br>third element in Array<br>you can use the grouped along with the<br>mapped and flat oh grouped oh<br>oh man that's some fire Scala<br>um<br>head<br>flatten<br>wait there's gonna be fire if this works<br>foreign<br>let's do it on small<br>I'm asking you<br>know we don't want to flatten I know<br>what we want to do<br>map<br>let's try that<br>close<br>um<br>I'm gonna flatten we want to concaten we<br>want to join<br>Scala joined string into list<br>or the other way around<br>see how to create a single string<br>oh dot make string<br>fire bro okay now we can do dot grouped<br>two<br>um this isn't exactly right because we<br>have to<br>Scala unzip<br>or I should be able to<br>map<br>that's gonna bitch and tell me some<br>iterator again<br>dot map<br>case x y<br>eval x y<br>mismatch error found x n e y but it's<br>grouped I don't understand<br>slice notation in scholar is that useful<br>to vector<br>or would I ever want a vector I hate<br>vectors<br>let me get the elements<br>actually kind of your Gap<br>value get is not a member of list string<br>I think it's not get it's just<br>scholarly's zero Index right it's not<br>like evil Lua iterator I love iterator<br>52.<br>oh that seems right<br>let's do some I'll get 70.<br>52.<br>wait what<br>the first group all the only type that<br>appears in all three okay never mind<br>we're doing this wrong<br>oh<br>okay<br>we have to find the one that's common in<br>all three<br>so we're close here<br>70. cool<br>or we're scholar Geniuses bros we're<br>scholar geniuses<br>this food was disgusting<br>should we followed up with a wheat and<br>gluten-free cookie<br>this is a real food normally don't eat<br>this<br>app there's no wheat and there's no<br>gluten what does it have in it<br>you know I'm hangry right now I eat a<br>fucking Snickers that's how hungry I am<br>I like Snickers<br>I don't like peanut butter<br>all right should we try Uber Eats again<br>I'm sorry Chad I haven't interacted with<br>you all the time but hopefully you like<br>that I've been writing Scala instructor<br>and that's what we all like to see on<br>streams right<br>do you like to see me be a noob and<br>struggle<br>[Music]<br>I know many people might work all of<br>them<br>you just gets things because he's famous<br>vaping<br>all right GrubHub<br>doordash really fucks up do I even have<br>a doordash account I'm sorry chat<br>thank you<br>it's pretty more water for my tea<br>the Twitter huge<br>ten times over<br>elon's not a big fan of feeding people<br>granola cookie bake all right fine it's<br>fine<br>we'll eat this<br>oh it just smells bad no I can't I can't<br>oh<br>vaping is my new hobby I Vape I play<br>chess and I go on Twitter<br>all right<br>they're probably the apartment never<br>mind uh<br>what's with the new skinhead haircut I<br>gotta look hardcore man<br>Vape is probably bad for you<br>how bad for you right a lot of things<br>are bad for you<br>smoking is bad for you<br>we have more water for my nice calming<br>tea<br>um<br>I know this is a terrible place this is<br>a terrible place<br>so at<br>you see me in San Diego I'm chill man<br>you know you know magic problem with my<br>favorite words<br>where should Twitter relocate to San<br>Diego man<br>Twitter wants me to stay at work that<br>longer San Diego<br>um San Jose is oh you like San Jose just<br>hold this holder<br>no Austin guys Austin is just San<br>Francisco running it back turbo like<br>it's it's not better<br>you can't have these ultra-left cities<br>like why<br>because people like them because they<br>have like like hipster coffee and stuff<br>like it's not worth it guys it's not<br>worth it<br>the shitty politics of your city will<br>creep into your tech company and you'll<br>end up with the Twitter files<br>all right<br>like these people are like like they<br>think you know these people here are<br>whacked out of their mind man they don't<br>say things like homeless you see what<br>what's like the politically correct word<br>for homeless now it's like unhoused<br>persons right like anyone who talks like<br>that is fucked<br>no I mean everyone knew the Twitter<br>files look like when Snowden came out I<br>mean I thought this is all nothing<br>Burger too like holy shit yeah of course<br>the NSA is spying on all your you know<br>Communications of course they're logging<br>all the metadata right like everyone<br>knew that everyone knew what all the<br>Twitter files were too like yeah Twitter<br>banned you from search like there's a<br>tool online to check this everyone knows<br>this<br>yeah well work from home's another hole<br>why do I want to work from this<br>oh man I'm just agitated you know<br>agitated it's like oh go outside and<br>enjoy something nice no I won't<br>um Twitter files are basic corporate<br>Behavior I mean we had a sort of<br>it's not<br>yes<br>the corporate behavior is broken is<br>basically what I'm gonna say<br>I agree and like look those people are<br>not terrible people you all understand<br>their decisions in isolation<br>but then when you like zoom out and say<br>wait a second<br>what are we building here right that's a<br>lot of the problem Twitter didn't<br>understand what they were building right<br>Elon says all the time this is the<br>Public Square I old Twitter never said<br>that<br>or they might have but you know they<br>just lost their way like what were they<br>actually building they were not trying<br>to build a Public Square<br>they were trying to build uh something<br>actually much more resembling a modern<br>Newsroom<br>oh<br>Google search sucks now not because<br>Google's been captured by ideologues<br>Google search sucks now because there's<br>no more internet to search<br>um what did I get done this week oh I<br>found some very interesting stuff this<br>week<br>like just I'm looking into there and<br>look Elon wants me to fix search<br>and<br>I don't know I mean this isn't secret<br>I'll talk about it like I can do<br>basically one or two things<br>I can ship a bunch of small mediocre<br>features or I can build you a really<br>impressive demo that won't be able to be<br>shipped for two years right like what do<br>you want<br>sorry the best engineer in the world<br>can't like ship this demo<br>um I'm not going to go into the reasons<br>why but like yes you can build<br>incredible demos that use modern large<br>language models use modern image<br>embeddings use like<br>fancy contrast of methods to figure out<br>what you want deploy rlhf in real time<br>yeah like you can do all these things<br>but not in 12 weeks<br>right and a lot of these things require<br>you to build up good infrastructure<br>beforehand I say this all the time at<br>comma the goal is not like solving<br>self-driving cars will be easy Once you<br>build the right infrastructure to do it<br>um<br>no no no no no I can't I can't stay in<br>this city more than 12 weeks man I miss<br>Alex I miss San Diego<br>uh<br>there's nothing about Twitter Twitter's<br>actually pretty nice<br>um though<br>we do need good food good food's<br>important to me common is good food<br>um how many more weeks uh I'm three<br>weeks in to 12 weekend to your chat<br>um<br>yeah the city's just<br>agitation and I I like I remember how I<br>used to feel when I lived here<br>how's the talent generally pretty good<br>actually<br>um you know I think that<br>the people who stayed are exactly sort<br>of the right people<br>uh there's some very good Engineers<br>there<br>right and yeah like<br>you know I am maybe there's a few more<br>to to uh<br>you know not not everyone but<br>most of the people I meet are very good<br>tiling window manager no I'm Italian<br>right there<br>when I stay at Twitter if they move to<br>another city if they move to San Diego I<br>think about it yeah<br>if they move to San Diego I'd think<br>about it and like look I could build<br>some really incredible ml stuff for<br>Twitter but it's going to take a year<br>um and I think there is much more<br>pressing priorities there right so again<br>nothing secret Twitter used to have<br>uh 7 500 people right<br>your code base reflects your<br>organization so when you have an<br>organization that is very clearly<br>overstaffed you have a code base that's<br>very very bloated<br>uh now<br>you know<br>what I would do is spend a lot of time<br>refactoring but you have to make a<br>choice do you want refactoring or do you<br>want features right and you can scream<br>both as loud as you want but you're not<br>going to get both<br>you're going to get<br>probably actually features if you scream<br>that you want both refactors and<br>features you're going to get features<br>uh<br>the slack channels are probably fun<br>though<br>yeah<br>you know they're they're not Bombshells<br>to discover it's all basically what you<br>think<br>um like I said I I promise you the<br>talent bar or Twitter has gone from here<br>to here now the the people currently at<br>Twitter are probably the average Twitter<br>employee now is probably considerably<br>more talented than the average Twitter<br>employee was right the good people they<br>believe<br>um there was a tweet I liked it was like<br>so the greatest entrepreneur uh you know<br>of Our Generation comes and buys your<br>company imagine what you could learn<br>from him imagine the impact you could<br>make imagine the opportunity but no you<br>resign LOL right like<br>um but if I refactor I can guarantee<br>three times performance<br>well can you right you can get there you<br>can get there and refactorings are<br>required refactoring can improve both<br>your performance and your velocity of<br>features but it takes time and there are<br>not obvious results tomorrow<br>so that's sort of the problem<br>um<br>I mean Elon is clearly you know whatever<br>I think maybe elon's doing the wrong<br>thing I do remember that he's a<br>billionaire and I'm not<br>uh so on average his decisions are<br>better than mine right and this is true<br>you can look at it you know it's the<br>same thing in chess right like someone<br>on average who has a higher rating than<br>you is making better moves than you<br>can I share the architecture of Twitter<br>I mean it's mostly public right well for<br>natural and finagle stuff is used<br>um you can you could read all that uh<br>that's like that Mike services<br>how's Advent code I'm not really doing<br>it this year<br>um I don't have time you look at my<br>GitHub my GitHub it's sad my github's<br>not even there's no green on my GitHub<br>right now<br>it's all it's all empty<br>um is Twitter bloated with microservices<br>uh look what Elon said was accurate<br>got to day nine and you're like meh<br>I don't I think microservices are a good<br>idea<br>um for the most part I I think that uh<br>it maybe has been taken to an episode<br>extreme<br>Alice I don't think Scala is a bad<br>choice I think skull is a fine<br>programming language like good luck I<br>mean look look at the code I've been<br>writing right<br>let me clean up all these stupid print<br>statements<br>that's pretty nice actually<br>I don't think I could write it much<br>faster in Python there's there's nothing<br>in Python there's nothing like called<br>grouped in Python is there not that I<br>know of<br>yeah there's no group to buy them<br>um in Python I would do like Zip and<br>then zero colon colon three and then one<br>colon colon three two column three<br>uh why not go Lang I mean yeah golang is<br>probably a better choice for<br>microservices than Scala that's what I<br>would choose today<br>but<br>I I mean I think there are more go<br>Engineers again there's nothing<br>fundamentally wrong with Scala<br>this is your favorite Scala project oh<br>chisel I don't know chisel was written<br>in sky<br>sorry this is gonna be a short stream<br>today I'm uh<br>maybe maybe I'll do one more at that<br>code<br>we have 843 people here all right we'll<br>do some more coding<br>I'm just I'm hungry<br>I'm hungry and I gotta get food all<br>right let's try ordering again<br>should we try Uber Eats part two<br>Getty<br>Istanbul Grill King of Thai Noodle<br>Grandma's homemade pasta I got some from<br>Grandma's homemade pasta it was very<br>mediocre so I tried a different pasta<br>place<br>should we just order the same thing<br>again<br>no it was 30 something dollars<br>so we should probably go out it's<br>raining<br>foreign<br>we'll do one more we'll do we'll do one<br>more problem and then I'm gonna go out<br>and find food<br>order the same thing but say it's for a<br>cop bro I don't think they like cops<br>around here<br>uh<br>look I'll Advocate as much as I can to<br>open source Twitter's infrastructure<br>you know but again when you look at<br>elon's other companies he hasn't really<br>open sourced much it was a struggle to<br>get Tesla to open source the Linux their<br>Linux kernel even which you legally have<br>to<br>um tiny cores and Scholar chisel<br>there's nothing really wrong with uh<br>with Scala<br>yeah I miss tiny grad I missed the tiny<br>Corp<br>all right<br>um<br>day four<br>consider the following section<br>assignment pairs<br>um<br>let me say uh fully contains the other<br>how many assignment pairs does one range<br>fully contain the other okay this is not<br>too hard so we're going to do lines dot<br>split<br>but see it can't be split<br>okay uh<br>[Music]<br>this is the last one guys<br>Can I some Bulls<br>clogbull is probably fine okay so we<br>want x dot<br>[Music]<br>um<br>can I split on two things<br>you can also split based on a regular<br>expression<br>and really what I want to do is like<br>that that might work<br>so in Scala VAR changes Val doesn't<br>true I'm just gonna bitch and be like uh<br>oh yeah I gotta equals here<br>no implicit ordering to find for be fine<br>L Javelin string<br>okay good<br>that works great I know my right Axis<br>okay<br>um we want to figure out if does one<br>range fully contain the uh there so<br>let's map<br>two inch<br>all right and then we can say a sub zero<br>all right so if it fully contains<br>then we have a sub 0 less than or equal<br>to a sub 2<br>and a sub 3 is less than or equal to a<br>sub 1.<br>or<br>the other way around<br>ah this one contains this one<br>um I'm gonna close that and one l0<br>453.<br>all right uh uh it's quite a bit of<br>duplicate work the number of pairs that<br>overlap at all how many overlap at all<br>okay<br>so if we want to know overlaps at all we<br>just have to check if<br>any of the numbers are in common<br>so I think I just need to check<br>uh<br>uh see this is like where like there's<br>like some people can do this very very<br>fast and that's his winning Advent code<br>if you train yourself a bit you get like<br>very fast at these things<br>we're not really trying to speed run<br>here we're just kind of<br>we're just kind of chilling and thinking<br>about how to write beautiful Scala<br>um okay so if this one is in the middle<br>we can just check this<br>or<br>this<br>can't hurt to check the others too<br>and there's<br>919<br>great<br>and Scholar three<br>yeah<br>uh<br>this one look fun that looks awful<br>we didn't have to even write any<br>algorithms this is all just like string<br>parsing<br>which is kind of lame<br>um no I mean I don't know like having a<br>code just like the times one of my<br>complaints about evident code last year<br>was that like the solve times for these<br>things was like a minute and we'll solve<br>times a minute you're no longer<br>rewarding like people who can program<br>you're rewarding people who have good<br>infrastructure and just happen to be<br>like like it's it's a reading<br>comprehension test instead of a<br>programming test<br>um which I mean it's still fun but it's<br>just not like<br>look at day 10 you found it pretty<br>enjoyable okay should we skip to 10. no<br>I can't do anything I need food<br>I need food let's look at ten Ten's<br>enjoyable<br>oh I do like things like this you know I<br>really like the first year I did it they<br>had a uh like an interpreter<br>they wrote like a tiny interpreter and<br>they built on it and every other one I<br>thought it was really cool<br>okay<br>[Music]<br>all right we'll do this one too<br>add V takes two cycles to complete<br>there's nothing like the op code thing<br>day 10 was math<br>[Music]<br>um<br>like the login pop-ups back<br>uh<br>that upsets me if that's true<br>nine is more fun than ten<br>I don't know no I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm done<br>with this<br>I gotta eat<br>uh look if the login pop-ups back like<br>that's that's that's so upsetting to<br>hear<br>um they don't have pieces that deliver<br>the login pop-up was gone for I removed<br>it for 99 of people the other one<br>percent look there's like PM still who<br>like<br>oh you can close it now okay as long as<br>you can close it<br>I'm not fighting it's it's a stupid<br>political battle like<br>you're just you're just you're just<br>losing I tried I tried guys<br>click on oh you have to click on login<br>and then click X oh my God<br>Knitter project in shambles now should<br>we build a Twitter competitor<br>foreign<br>should we build a clean Twitter<br>how do we build it<br>how would we build new clean Twitter<br>oh it never allowed you to browse likes<br>or media<br>what's actually wrong with Mastodon I've<br>heard that all people do it you know the<br>problem with Mastodon is the same<br>problem with troop social and parlor<br>right<br>so when like these new ones show up<br>who goes who legitimately signed up for<br>truth social and was like this is going<br>to be a community I want to be a part of<br>nobody right you got a bunch of like<br>rabid Trump fans and you know it sucked<br>it was a terrible Community right<br>um mastodon's the same thing right<br>the but it you know usually people are<br>used to this happening with like the<br>right-win people fragmenting like when<br>Reddit kicks off the Donald and they go<br>to the donald.win right like it's it's<br>usually people it's the right wing who<br>leaves but on Mastodon it was the left<br>wing who laughed all the oh you know<br>Twitter is owned by a billionaire and I<br>hate billionaires I'm gonna go to<br>Mastodon where they know how to run a<br>social network<br>um<br>so yeah I mean the problem isn't even<br>the Mastodon technology it's like do I<br>really want to hang around those people<br>like everyone on Twitter I see who has<br>the Mastodon in their profile is like<br>this person doesn't seem cool man<br>uh what do I think of urban well I mean<br>or if it's a lot better right or Urban's<br>a lot better Urban suffers a lot less<br>from these uh<br>from these from these problems<br>uh all the cool people are showing<br>Twitter yeah I mean it's true right<br>all right I'm sorry there's no more<br>programming today I'm hungry my food<br>didn't show up<br>and try to order food with the GrubHub<br>app<br>uh no Urban does exist right so Urban's<br>interesting in the I mean urban has a I<br>think there's another like Arena like it<br>has this sort of<br>um<br>hipster early adopter vibe to it and the<br>the people there don't really seem like<br>it seems like there's like a political<br>balance there and it seems like people<br>are there because they're excited about<br>like<br>weird esoteric technology which is cool<br>like you can you can build a community<br>around that they're they're into like<br>artificial difficulty<br>right yeah who is a disaster right like<br>like knock and Hoon are not serious<br>programming languages right nobody would<br>argue that that hoon is like a serious<br>programming language<br>but it's it's kind of like the way<br>people like like<br>esoteric stuff<br>right<br>similar to like I mean I see some<br>overlap with like like the 8-Bit video<br>game Community right like the people are<br>like oh yeah look what I made the NES do<br>right<br>um am I on Twitter HQ no that's my<br>apartment<br>smoking a cigarette<br>um<br>there's a whole Twitter thing is<br>political one side believes the guy who<br>took over is against their politics well<br>yeah but you see look the problem is<br>like elon's not a political extremist at<br>all right Elon and he talks about this<br>all the time he's a Centrist<br>right so yes if their ideology is we are<br>far left Communists who believe that<br>like you know uh gendered pronouns<br>should be abolished and everyone should<br>just be they and you know we can all<br>look like NPCs yeah like if you believe<br>that yeah this guy's probably against<br>your politics but that's a wacko idea<br>right<br>um so yeah I mean yes anyone talks about<br>this too he's like well yeah we want the<br>extremists to leave right both the<br>extremists laughed and the extremist<br>right and yeah everyone like there<br>should no one wants extremists they're<br>just terrible<br>I mean yeah Elon reinstated Trump right<br>like<br>why was Trump banned in the first place<br>how absurd was that<br>it's just like<br>can you believe they actually banned the<br>president of the United States from<br>Twitter<br>and you can read like the justification<br>and it's absurd<br>it's not like uh it's not like uh you<br>know this guy was actually like<br>you know I mean<br>what did he do right<br>uh so if if if one side has a group<br>where you know that Donald Trump<br>shouldn't even be allowed to talk well<br>that's a bit extreme right I think it<br>would also be a bit extreme if someone<br>like you know wanted to kick Biden off<br>of Twitter right if Trump had reinstated<br>Trump and kicked Biden off yeah fuck<br>that guy right like no one wants that<br>right like this is this is the problem<br>um<br>right but you know you want to let<br>everybody talk and then let everybody<br>you know you should be able to listen to<br>everybody and make up your own mind if<br>you really like what Donald Trump has to<br>say you can listen to him right uh you<br>know<br>foreign<br>can we kick the terrorists off<br>I mean<br>who's a terrorist right<br>like one man's terrorist is another<br>man's Freedom Fighter right<br>it depends it depends what they're doing<br>are they you know where I think the line<br>should be I think the line should be<br>illegal in the United States right if if<br>they're posting things on Twitter that<br>are illegal in the United States like<br>imminent you know violent threats uh<br>child porn like things that are illegal<br>in the United States yeah you should be<br>kicked off Twitter otherwise you can<br>talk and people can listen or not<br>right<br>I mean they literally execute people<br>yeah but I mean I ran as a sovereign<br>country right<br>so you can say that you don't like them<br>and that's fine but are they breaking<br>United States law<br>and then also it's not like he's<br>executing people on Twitter<br>um<br>who's getting ad money from the EU yeah<br>I mean if the EU wants to pass laws<br>against legal speech in America then you<br>know what my take is fuck the EU man<br>like they can set up a great firewall if<br>they want<br>um yeah us doesn't execute anyone<br>exactly right like like the US is<br>responsible for more<br>killings and death and like<br>well great the Iran guy exit how many<br>people do we kill in Iraq like you know<br>um so it's different I mean what is a<br>country a country is a monopoly on<br>violence right the state is a monopoly<br>on violence so when a state does<br>violence it's not like an individual<br>doing violence<br>do I know what Elon and Tim Cook talked<br>about I really don't know I don't have<br>any insight that's not really just<br>what's on elon's Twitter<br>um like I don't know if Iran is bad<br>honestly I don't know enough about it<br>but I think that there should just be<br>like Fair very permissive rules on a<br>place you want to call the Town Square<br>and then like Scott Alexander has a has<br>a post where he talks about moderation<br>it's not censorship right if you don't<br>want to see Donald Trump's tweets that<br>should be your not right but like we're<br>trying to make a good platform right<br>yeah block Donald Trump Right add a<br>keyword block for Donald Trump great you<br>don't have to see it but to say that<br>like Donald Trump can't talk to somebody<br>who wants to hear him talk is absurd<br>right<br>like like censorship is when a third<br>when you have two parties who consent to<br>communicate and a third party says well<br>actually we're not going to allow them<br>to communicate right<br>I'm not turning Twitter into 4chan and<br>again there should be some<br>civility<br>right<br>um I mean Twitter for one is not really<br>anonymous<br>uh isn't there somebody you forgot to<br>ask that's right<br>um hate speech is not illegal in the U.S<br>there is no clear definition of hate<br>speech the U.S has this thing called a<br>Brandenburg test right<br>this is this is<br>this is basically the uh the limitations<br>on on on free speech<br>uh in America right<br>um cannot punish inflammatory speech<br>unless that speech is directed to<br>inciting or producing imminent Lawless<br>action and is likely to incite or<br>produce such action right imminent<br>Lawless action<br>and is likely to incite or produce such<br>action right you can do hate speech all<br>you want you can talk about how Hitler<br>was great you know you can talk about<br>how you know you you you you want all<br>the redheads to die like you can do that<br>but you know there's a test<br>hate speech doesn't protect you from<br>being punched in the face no it's<br>illegal to punch people in the face<br>right because someone<br>because someone says something you don't<br>like it's not okay to punch them in the<br>face right<br>oh so yeah yeah this is why Clips aren't<br>allowed right this is why Clips aren't<br>allowed actually I for full of contacts<br>I actually don't think Hitler was great<br>I think he was a loser uh I think he<br>killed himself sad in a bunker like he<br>was a loser man you know say what you<br>want even about what he believed like<br>the guy was a fucking loser<br>um<br>the core problem in America is that no<br>one understands Civics well they should<br>have paid attention in seventh grade<br>you had a wife one day and then I think<br>they dated but like not look I don't<br>know man I don't know my I don't know my<br>my hitlerology that much I said the guy<br>was like they didn't let him into art<br>school man the guy was a loser<br>[Music]<br>um<br>whenever EU demands matter so the rules<br>will be the average of the U.S and EU<br>yeah<br>yeah I don't agree<br>I don't know what if the EU would like<br>to stand up a great firewall and block<br>my website they can<br>uh<br>is there a line where you would say that<br>someone Justified being punched no<br>This Is How Free Speech works<br>do you know what I mean like it's not<br>okay to respond to speech with violence<br>like<br>basic American shit guys<br>um I'm not that interested in what Kanye<br>has to say he's got a he's awesome he's<br>on some weird Trip Man<br>no no it's not okay to punch people<br>because you don't like what they're<br>saying<br>oh<br>I I get yeah it's a mercy band man it<br>was a mercy band really<br>um you can verbally punch somebody<br>that's right you can you can you can you<br>know put a fire diss track together<br>that's all fine<br>um it's okay if you're a state yes it is<br>okay a state is a monopoly on violence<br>yes<br>all right uh politics is stupid guys uh<br>thank you for watching today's stream<br>uh<br>uh I I honestly I don't have an opinion<br>on Iran<br>um<br>is Twitter hiring yeah Twitter's hiring<br>Twitter's hiring uh<br>I'm not I'm interned I don't have any I<br>don't have any insight into that but I<br>do think uh<br>oh python three python 312's out<br>hungry I'm tired I hate this city<br>ah<br>you know you know the sad thing about<br>politics I heard a quote that upset me<br>it's like<br>you might not be interested in politics<br>but politics is interested in you so<br>like here's what I Hope's happening I<br>hope that like<br>a whole group of people who's just<br>absolutely fed up with the bullshit<br>shows up and you know look I think<br>elon's in this group right<br>politics is a little more appropriate<br>than usual because honestly why did I go<br>to Twitter<br>I came to work at Twitter because I<br>believe in free speech<br>I believe a lot in free speech I think<br>it's uh<br>you ever see the graph where it shows uh<br>IQ versus belief in free speech right<br>also you know<br>um<br>better salary and comma dying<br>November was our all-time profit record<br>at comma for a month<br>now we made more money in November than<br>we'd ever made before<br>uh thank you to everyone who purchased<br>the common three on Black Friday<br>um<br>I'm trying to comma next I gotta leave<br>the city<br>why'd I leave comma because I'm a<br>quitter quitter man<br>um<br>it was two times of people people want<br>to be left alone and people who don't<br>want to leave them alone yeah that<br>sounds right<br>uh no I think there's a real change<br>I can feel the change in the air boys I<br>can feel the change in the air you know<br>this isn't<br>this isn't this isn't a winner or the<br>culture War this is just both sides of<br>the culture War being told to shut the<br>fuck up that's what I'm talking about<br>that's what I want to see man you know<br>nice like we can we can like yeah the<br>extremes of both sides are just<br>ridiculed right<br>Vibes be shifting right Vibes are<br>shifting that's how I feel<br>uh yeah AMD doesn't have any good<br>opening eye come out with something that<br>performs comma not easily<br>um we are years ahead<br>in a whole bunch of things like it's<br>gonna be really hard to<br>engineering is a

              "John playing checkers yeah I mean and again it's  <br>scanning the source of the internet to say like \n",

              "was some discussion about you know how did you  <br>again train the AI to learn about different styles \n",

just starting<br>out write your comments down below so<br>game design definitely is a specialized<br>feel and there's lots of skills that are<br>involved in that especially idea<br>generation basic

also creativity within the<br>game design environment I think chat GPT<br>and other AI tools as well are just that<br>they're just tools they're not going to<br>replace human designers anytime soon so<br>don't throw in the towel just yet I<br>think as human game designers we need to<br>grow yes I think we need to grow by<br>using these tools they're not only going<br>to make our jobs easier and they're<br>going to push our creativity and allow<br>us to accomplish way more just think how<br>much that's going to benefit the player<br>as a game designer I think Chad gbt and<br>all these other

high-level tasks<br>and important things on my plate that<br>when it comes to content creation my<br>mental bandwidth has already been used<br>up I found it really difficult to be<br>creative so I discovered chat GPT and I<br>wanted to see if the tool could be used<br>to help me in my content creation<br>process so in this video I'll show you<br>three ways that I've discovered that you<br>can use chat GPT in your content<br>creation process again as a Founder I<br>know the importance of spending your<br>time on High level tasks and not the<br>tasks that don't generate revenue or<br>don't move your business forward<br>focusing on those high level tasks has<br>allowed me to build this second business<br>of my own to a million dollars a year in<br>Revenue within a year now I know that I<br>can focus on these high level tasks but<br>then content creation suffers I need to<br>focus on those high level tasks but<br>again content still needs to be created<br>so in this video I will be covering how<br>you can eliminate 99 percent of your<br>content creation process using chat GPT<br>so let's get started alright so once<br>you've logged into chat GPT it's really<br>easy to log in you just use your Gmail<br>login or just easily sign up you will<br>have to put in a phone number to verify<br>that you are who you are so once we're<br>in chat GPT Let's do an example of write<br>a blog article for avoiding burnout in a<br>startup and we'll see what it comes up<br>with<br>so now it'll start typing and we'll wait<br>until it's done<br>okay so chat GPT finished up it actually<br>already renamed my chat right there<br>avoiding burnout in startups and we have<br>a solid blog article and so the beauty<br>of chat GPT is that now I'm not working<br>with a blank page I gave a very basic<br>prompt avoiding burnout in a startup and<br>now I can go in with my personal<br>experiences my personal knowledge wisdom<br>and knowing who my audience is I can now<br>you know copy and paste this into a<br>Google doc and start editing it so maybe<br>I want to take out prioritize tasks or<br>maybe I want to combine these two points<br>or maybe I want to get rid of this point<br>or add a new point you know there's so<br>many it's endlessly customizable because<br>now I'm not starting with a blank page I<br>have this template basically here's a<br>template article about avoiding burnout<br>in a startup and so the the beauty of<br>chat gbt is giving you content that is<br>you know hopefully 99 of the way there<br>so there are other things that we can do<br>to find what chat GPT puts out and then<br>even a kind of supplementary material as<br>well so let's say write a title for that<br>blog article and let's see what it gives<br>us<br>five tips for avoiding burnout in a<br>startup great that's awesome we have a<br>summary for that blog article and so now<br>hopefully it'll just give us a brief<br>description of what the blog article is<br>about so now we can post that into a<br>social media post with a link to the<br>full actual blog article and so it gives<br>us this blog article provides tips for<br>avoiding burnout in a startup including<br>these Five Points by following these<br>tips startup employees can manage their<br>workload more effectively and maintain<br>their physical mental health beautiful<br>so now I have a title now I have a<br>description and now I have the full blog<br>article again which I can edit each one<br>of these but it's giving me some great<br>ideas to start with and you can even<br>have it you know ideate for you give you<br>ideas so we could say write pen titles<br>or that blog article and so now we can<br>choose between these 10 titles or use<br>you know part of this title and a part<br>of this title and we'll see what it<br>comes up with in just a second great so<br>now we have 10 ideas or different titles<br>for that blog Article Five simple<br>strategies for managing burnout in a<br>startup I think that's probably the best<br>one but you can use any of these right<br>that's the beauty of chat GPT so you can<br>also refine the blog article you can<br>always add additional criteria you could<br>even do you know write a 300 word blog<br>article about avoiding burnout and it<br>will do that for you so I've noticed it<br>doesn't keep exactly the 300 words it'll<br>be like 320 words but it's pretty close<br>and you know you can continue to refine<br>the queries and it will just continue to<br>put out a more and more polished output<br>which of course you know then you can<br>finish that one percent of effort really<br>personalize it for your audience and to<br>put it in your voice to get and to put<br>in your own personal experiences the<br>second way that we can use chat GPT in<br>our content creation strategy is for<br>newsletters so write a newsletter<br>about delegation and automation<br>all right so now chat gbt has given us a<br>rough template of a newsletter about<br>delegation and automation you can see<br>it's in the rough structure of a<br>newsletter again I wouldn't send this<br>right away but I would put in my own<br>personal experiences I would structure<br>it maybe a little bit differently put in<br>you know three points which you could<br>probably also tell chat gbt to do for<br>you just you know come up with three of<br>your top tips when it comes to<br>delegation and automation so let's see<br>what other you know queries can we give<br>chat GPT about writing a newsletter we<br>could say instead of write a newsletter<br>about delegation and automation we could<br>say instead maybe something a little bit<br>more complicated so write a newsletter<br>about what happens when a company hits a<br>growth wall and we'll see if it comes up<br>with anything good for that all right<br>great so chat GPT has given us a solid<br>newsletter about what happens when a<br>company hits a growth wall assess the<br>cause of the gross slowdown when you hit<br>a growth wall your company's growth<br>begins to slow or just Plateau<br>completely and so that could mean that<br>you need to invest in marketing and<br>sales you need to increase the amount of<br>new customers coming in or you can<br>decrease churn so you know assess the<br>cause of the gross slow down extremely<br>important so I would structure this<br>differently and I would introduce<br>Concepts a little bit differently but<br>it's a again it's a great starting point<br>for a newsletter about what happens when<br>a company hits a growth wall now the<br>third point or the third way that chat<br>GPT can help us when it comes to<br>creating content is for our social media<br>so if I want to post daily on LinkedIn<br>which I have been doing for about a year<br>it does get exhausting after a while of<br>constantly coming up with new topics new<br>ideas and new posts so again let's ask<br>chat GPT how it can help us with that<br>ideas for a LinkedIn post directed<br>towards startup Founders and let's see<br>what it comes up with all right great so<br>now we have five ideas of different<br>posts I could make on LinkedIn about<br>directed towards startup Founders Five<br>Lessons I've learned as a startup<br>founder the importance of mentorship for<br>Founders the role of failure in the<br>startup Journey the benefits of<br>diversity and inclusion in startup teams<br>and the power of networking for startup<br>Founders and I could even say generate<br>let's say I'm not happy with those first<br>ideas or I've already used them generate<br>five more ideas<br>all right great so now it's coming up<br>with five more ideas which are all solid<br>ideas that I would use for a LinkedIn<br>post now let's get started on our next<br>query which would be let's say write a<br>script or a tick tock video directed<br>towards startup Founders shot list<br>include in table format let's see what<br>that comes up with all right so I am<br>continually impressed by what chat GPT<br>can come up with we've got at the very<br>beginning a shot list it's not in table<br>format but that's fine so it's got these<br>eight different shots that we should<br>include in The Tick Tock video and now<br>it goes down into the script and these<br>are all the things that I should be<br>saying and then look you know right here<br>it includes okay now move to shot two<br>which we can see you know what that is a<br>shot of a person sitting at a desk<br>typing on a laptop and looking focused<br>and then it says you know go to shot<br>three shot four shot five so it's really<br>cool to see how it structured this<br>script and I'm sure there's a lot of<br>people that would say okay you know<br>those shots suck or you know that script<br>isn't great but it gives me a starting<br>point now I know okay yeah I don't want<br>that in that shot but now I have a<br>better idea of what I do want in that<br>shot or you know the rough structure for<br>this Tick Tock video and so all of these<br>different things as I've been saying<br>throughout the video it's just so<br>helpful to start with not a blank page<br>and start with some rough structure of<br>how it could look and then you can know<br>really quickly what you do want it to<br>look like and what does work in what<br>chat GPT has given you and what doesn't<br>work so it's very easy for you to add<br>and take away what jet GPT has given you<br>and condense it down into something that<br>will actually be successful and that<br>will actually be presentable for your<br>audience<br>now this isn't perfect but it's much<br>better than any other AI tool that I've<br>used in generating content paid or free<br>and it's easy to refine the content that<br>chat GPT puts out and it's really easy<br>to just add in your own personal<br>experiences your own personal wisdom and<br>of course make sure that everything<br>sounds like it's coming from you that it<br>has your voice so if you're a business<br>owner in need of content go use chat gbt<br>especially while it's still free and<br>pump out as much content as you can you<br>can always refine it later follow me<br>here on YouTube if you want to learn<br>more about startup systems and how to<br>systematize your business I want to help<br>Founders win back their time through<br>Automation and delegation</td></tr><tr><td>Bll_Ws_NNtk</td><td>It's Christmas time again and everyone is in a festive mood.<br>But there is something lurking in the shadows, something that could ruin all the fun.<br>I'm talking about ChatGPT, the tool of artificial intelligence that conquers the internet in a storm.<br>From a superficial point of view, ChatGPT seems to be a harmless possibility to<br>pass the time a little. You type in a message and it answers with a<br>click. But in reality ChatGPT is dangerous. It has the ability to learn and adapt.<br>And it is not always clear what it thinks. At Christmas, when people are in a good mood and<br>share their joy with others, ChatGPT can take advantage of this. It can entice people<br>to give personal information or even persuade them to do something<br>that they might regret. So be especially careful in this Christmas season and think<br>twice before you get involved with ChatGPT. You never know what's ahead.<br>Sorry, I couldn't resist that. This intro was of course created with an AI,<br>more precisely with ChatGPT. ChatGPT is a software created by OpenAI,<br>which is based on the GPT-3 AI. Incidentally, this is the same one that also works in the background for<br>DOLI or Replica, which I have already dealt with in more detail.<br>ChatGPT is a pure chat application, but it can assist rather than really<br>communicate out of this chat. The applications are diverse. I don't know if you've seen it on<br>social media, but there's everything from chats with fictitious people to<br>song texts. And of course you can ask critically how far an AI can go,<br>which data it can use, will I lose my job and so much more.<br>We won't do that here. But I will be asking these questions on my other channel<br>next year, the Morphois, the former vlog channel. So if you are interested in a more general approach<br>to this topic, feel free to stop by. This is about how ChatGPT can and will<br>change the lives of developers and IT people for us and how much fear of loss of jobs we really<br>have to have. Before we start, next Friday at 2 p.m. there will be a little Christmas party<br>on my Twitch, where we will do a community quiz. So I will create the quiz and you can<br>participate and dust off the winners. Everyone over 18 can participate and I would be very happy<br>if you all came by. Streaming is a bit more personal than such a video.<br>Nevertheless, here are your life-changing tips. First, generate code. Let's start with the<br>most obvious. ChatGPT builds code for you. You heard right, you can just ask for it.<br>I have had Python code for the MergeSort Sort Here algorithm built for this video<br>here for testing purposes. And look, it really worked. See for yourself, the code is functional,<br>the variables are well named, the code itself is also quite Pythonic, for example, uses<br>R, i.e. a list from beginning to end or from middle to end, and it has damn good<br>documentation. It is all created as a function and it contains example code to test it right away.<br>What the actual? Of course I played around a little more and have to say, the code that is generated<br>is not bad, but of course not error-free either. In many cases where no<br>frequent algorithm was asked, there were already a few errors. But such a coding challenge<br>was not only solved. No, the naive algorithm would run in O of n3. The<br>chatGPT algorithm runs more efficiently than that and is even documented cleanly. But is that really<br>the case? Take a closer look. Second, tests. To be able to really say that, the human<br>programmer has to write unit tests, right? No, wrong. You can also simply use chatGPT to generate tests<br>and do that completely without foreknowledge and with a really impressive test coverage.<br>I mean, look at that. The good thing about it is that the function must or should of course not know chatGPT<br>in advance. Because chatGPT writes the tests, you the implementation or you let<br>chatGPT do that again. Third, several languages. You are not Python developers? Well, no problem.<br>chatGPT can also obviously also JavaScript and PHP and C and what the... can even bank Cobol.<br>Investment now. So I think the Cobol can, I can't. That's problematic,<br>but hey, why is Cobol code actually so incredibly long?<br>By the way, it's even possible to brainfuck. So I think. Fourth, Stack Overflow. We all know<br>the worst situation in the everyday life of a developer. You are looking for a bug online<br>and can't find a Stack Overflow post that fits. Now you have two options. Try it yourself<br>or write a post and both are more scary than the Christmas brunch with the family.<br>If you post yourself, you will probably be made too dirty. If you try it yourself, it is suddenly<br>weekend again. Fear Not chatGPT is no. A simple explanation for, for example, main in<br>Python spits out the AI without any problems, including a nice explanation. A bit more complex<br>tasks you have to read through two or three times. The answer itself is<br>actually quite good, especially if you ask things that are perhaps very specific.<br>But what we see here again, individual questions work quite well, but there can also be<br>errors contained, which can be problematic with such problems. But to be honest,<br>that it even knows this very niche bug is impressive. There are even problem<br>solutions included. And what we should not forget, not all Stack Overflow answers are correct.<br>Fifth, optimize code. You can also give chatGPT algorithms that should optimize it for you.<br>In this example here I generated a random number between 1 and 100 and regenerated it<br>until it was divisible by 4. O of pretty long. Potentially, the thing runs infinitely.<br>chatGPT spits out code from house that is much more efficient. First generate a random number<br>between 1 and 25 and then multiply by 4. That was even the solution I had<br>thought of before and it runs the O of 1. Insanely impressive if you ask me.<br>If you now benchmark your code and optimize this one function, which takes up a large part of the<br>overall runtime, this could really lead to much faster software without a lot of work.<br>Sixth, look for security gaps. You are not sure if you may have a<br>security gap in your code? You can also ask chatGPT here. In this example<br>I don't even ask directly for security problems, I just ask if the thing is okay.<br>I even get directly told that the function I use is outdated, i.e. deprecated,<br>and that a SQL injection is possible. In the end, a few suggestions come and even<br>additionally functional good code. Hopefully that was really okay.<br>Seventh, let yourself be explained code. Are you not sure what this one<br>strange colleague did there? You can even be analyzed what a special code actually does.<br>Sometimes it's not that easy, but still impressive.<br>I tried to find something he doesn't recognize, but he even recognized a C solution from<br>an Advent of Code puzzle as such. And I got a little clumsy there.<br>Actually, chatGPT says that it has no access to the internet and is somewhere at the level of 2021.<br>And this puzzle is from December 4th this year, just a few days before writing the<br>actual script. So if anyone knows what happened and how it works, always get on with it.<br>Eighth, have configuration files created. chatGPT also speaks<br>Docker by the way. Here is an example of a Docker file for WordPress.<br>Also Docker Compose is no problem. Even volumes are used and<br>worked with environment variables. So no basic stuff.<br>Ninth, security tips. Even if you ask the AI for IT security tips,<br>the most important options actually come out. However, the AI recommends<br>changing passwords regularly, which is controversial. But rules for a firewall<br>are also spitting chatGPT out sensibly. No real rules, of course, but sensible guidelines.<br>Tenth, employee care. You want to throw a New Year's party with nerds,<br>make employees familiar with each other, plan a cool business event.<br>The AI also provides a lot of ideas for this. My favorite, have a nerd karaoke night.<br>Danger and benefits. You see, this thing is your personal stack overflow,<br>which always responds directly and does not shame you. But I see a very important problem<br>that chatGPT even points out at the start page. Apart from all the other things<br>like copyright etc. The correctness. Yes, I can now use an AI to generate code, tests and<br>documentation. For the light problems, this works really well.<br>For complex tasks, it will probably work brilliantly when it comes out of the beta.<br>I give the whole thing a maximum of a handful of years, but there is still a problem.<br>We developers and IT people must not be lazy. Our problems are sometimes incredibly specific<br>and we cannot leave it entirely to an AI. But we also see that AI sometimes comes up with solutions<br>that we may not even have on the screen. We should not be afraid to<br>accept our toolset, because it is so powerful that it can change our entire workflow<br>and that is positive. But we should not forget that as human programmers,<br>this tool also makes mistakes. I see that the work of developers and IT people is<br>increasingly taking on a management role. More communication, understanding what is<br>required at all, understanding how to divide a complex problem into its subproblems.<br>The AI does not take that away from you. Nevertheless, I am particularly afraid of managers or<br>bosses who suddenly think they can do everything themselves and simply get<br>some hosting materials created by chatGPT. They will have IT security problems<br>and not just that, I promise you. You always need a person who knows<br>their area really well. But one thing is for sure, an excuse why you don't write me any tests<br>anymore, you don't have them anymore. Bonus I already have so many ideas what I can do with<br>this AI. In the coming year I will implement some videos with it. You can be<br>curious. But since that is mostly content for my other channels, here again<br>the call to subscribe to it. Also look past the stream on Friday at 2 pm, maybe you will<br>even find a question that was asked by this AI. But don't worry, you can't cheat,<br>unless you can really, really quickly. I wish the other one a Merry Christmas and a<br>great start to the new year. My last video this year will be on the other channel on the 23rd.<br>Between the years I also take a break. Take a break and come back to the new year. See you then!</td></tr><tr><td>Np6dYd3GrJ0</td><td>Hi, this is ManantialVE.<br>This tutorial will be a bit different. <br>I’ll show you how to use ChatGPT \n",

their AI tool<br>and in this video I'm kind of borrowing<br>this idea from somebody who did it on<br>Twitter they did a Twitter thread and I<br>thought you know what that's really<br>interesting so I might just do it on my<br>YouTube channel why not uh hopefully I'm<br>not the only one that thinks it's<br>interesting and I'm gonna ask it I'm<br>gonna have a conversation with AI<br>however that works I'm going to ask it<br>basically how can I make money online in<br>2023 you know I only know what I know<br>um but I'm faced with my human<br>limitations so let's see what the uh the<br>best AI tool out there that I'm aware of<br>is going to tell me to do so I can<br>increase my online passive income in<br>2023.<br>foreign<br>guys so I'm on openai.com you may have<br>caught my previous videos where I used<br>their older AI tool and I allowed it to<br>basically provide me Niche ideas for<br>various print-on-demand designs for<br>instance if I wanted to uh make a design<br>with a lake on it and then say hey can<br>you create me a list of all the biggest<br>lakes in the United States it would do<br>that for me so the chat GPT I think is<br>meant to be more conversational so why<br>don't I ask it um<br>have any ideas on how I can make money<br>online<br>and it says there are many ways to make<br>money online and the specific method you<br>choose will depend on your skills<br>interests and the amount of time you<br>have available here are a few ideas to<br>get you started one start a blog or<br>website if you have a passion for a<br>particular subject you can start a blog<br>or website where you share your<br>knowledge and experiences with others<br>you can earn money through advertising<br>sponsorships and affiliate marketing I<br>actually do have my blog already<br>reinhoge.com if you guys didn't know<br>that and I have another website that I<br>made over a decade ago that still brings<br>in some advertising and direct<br>sponsorship money as well<br>so I like that idea I can I can<br>definitely get behind that<br>two sell products or Services if you<br>have a skill or Talent you can use the<br>internet to sell products or services to<br>customers this could include things like<br>handmade crafts<br>artwork photography or Consulting<br>Services hey another great tip and I<br>think I technically am doing that as<br>well I sell products I have my FBA<br>business my print on demand business and<br>I do sell some services like Consulting<br>for instance uh you know there's always<br>a link in the description<br>three complete online surveys many<br>companies are willing to pay for<br>Consumer feedback and insights you can<br>sign up to participate in online surveys<br>and earn money in your spare time and<br>that's another good tip I don't know if<br>I would recommend it for you guys I used<br>to use this website called Swagbucks<br>Swagbucks and you could do like simple<br>tasks every day and get paid in points<br>and then redeem the points for Amazon<br>gift cards and you could also like run<br>these apps on your phone that just ran<br>ads all the time so I bought like five<br>little smartphones and just kept them<br>running ads all day and I was getting<br>like you know Amazon gift cards pretty<br>often so it wasn't a bad deal but I<br>think that was a long time ago probably<br>like six years ago seven years ago so I<br>wouldn't recommend it anymore today but<br>I haven't also really been looking into<br>it the surveys though are very manual<br>process and can take forever so I<br>wouldn't recommend that relative to what<br>you get paid in my experience<br>four offer freelance Services the<br>internet has made it easier than ever<br>for Freelancers to find work in a wide<br>range of fields<br>if you have a specific skill such as<br>writing graphic design or programming<br>you can offer your services to clients<br>online<br>and I mean guys hard to disagree there<br>right hard to disagree you can go to<br>websites like Fiverr and post a gig and<br>name your price and see if people are<br>willing to hire you at that price you<br>know make sure it's worth your time you<br>can go to Craigslist even though<br>Craigslist is more of a local thing you<br>can still I mean I don't know where you<br>guys live but where I live there's<br>millions of people and you can for sure<br>be found selling your services so that's<br>something that is worth considering<br>uh number five invest in the stock<br>market another way to make money online<br>is to invest in the stock market while<br>this option carries a certain amount of<br>risk it can also provide the potential<br>for higher returns if you make smart<br>investment decisions<br>hard to disagree with number five too um<br>when it comes to investing I would<br>probably recommend generally speaking uh<br>keeping it high level probably just<br>invest in index funds there's one called<br>the uh the ticker is spy and it just<br>tracks the S P 500 and it pays a<br>dividend if you are a passive investor<br>then you're not a Trader right you're<br>not trading in and out of positions<br>you're just investing and doing nothing<br>uh you can just go with you know the s p<br>index uh the Spy<br>ETF get paid a dividend as well and it<br>pretty much tracks inflation you know<br>most of the time so you can at least<br>protect your buying power there or you<br>can just buy Apple stock which is<br>literally a two trillion dollar company<br>and if it goes down pretty much the<br>whole world's Financial system will go<br>down so it's pretty much guaranteed to<br>be propped up to a certain extent uh and<br>they'll have to intervene if anything<br>crazy happens all right there's a try<br>again button why don't we track that or<br>try that and see if they come up with<br>like a different response here<br>um I haven't gone too in depth with my<br>usage of this tool<br>and it looks like it's struggling to<br>respond so maybe we even just<br>um hit refresh how can I what should we<br>say we should say something about print<br>on demand is<br>it worth starting a print on demand<br>business is it worth starting a<br>print-on-demand business what do you<br>guys think the AI will say<br>starting a print-on-demand business can<br>be a great way to sell products without<br>having to invest in inventory or<br>fulfillment however as with any business<br>it's important to carefully consider the<br>potential challenges and opportunities<br>before making the decision to start one<br>some things to consider include the<br>potential competition in the market the<br>costs of setting up and running the<br>business and the potential demand for<br>your products it's also important to<br>have a solid business plan in place and<br>to be prepared to put in the work and<br>effort required to make the business<br>successful overall whether or not<br>starting a print-on-demand business is<br>worth it will depend on your individual<br>circumstances and goals<br>yeah it's a good response it's also such<br>a nuanced you know response where<br>they're kind of just like it could be<br>good it could be bad you know worry<br>about a business plan think about your<br>Market you know it's good advice I guess<br>but it's also very um high level about<br>as high level as it could possibly be<br>all right I guess if you ask it the<br>wrong question it just gets hung up<br>because I've gotten hung up the last<br>couple times I've tried to uh request<br>some T-shirt design ideas t-shirt niches<br>so why don't we try this one more time<br>I'm gonna say I'd like to sell<br>t-shirts online what<br>uh can you provide a list of of shirt<br>Niche ideas question mark please answer<br>sure here are a few t-shirt Niche ideas<br>thank you uh first sports teams fans<br>love to show their support for their<br>favorite teams so t-shirts with team<br>logos or slogans could be popular<br>obviously as the uh YouTuber here I have<br>to say that there are restrictions on<br>what we're allowed to sell you don't<br>want to commit intellectual property<br>infringement so be careful there<br>pop culture t-shirts with references to<br>popular TV shows movies or memes could<br>be a hit with fans of those things so<br>same thing kind of applies there<br>Hobbies if you're passionate about a<br>particular hobby like gardening or<br>hiking you could create t-shirts with<br>designs related to that Hobby<br>social causes t-shirts with slogans or<br>designs related to social causes like<br>environmentalism or mental health<br>awareness could be a great way to spread<br>awareness and support those causes<br>humor funny t-shirts with clever jokes<br>or puns can be a hit with people looking<br>for a good laugh and I have to say yes<br>humorous designs are the way to go and<br>somehow some way the AI<br>it knew to suggest humor now I don't<br>know if it understands what the word<br>humor or funny means or you know<br>contextually if it could detect it but<br>uh it's definitely I would say I can I<br>can definitely agree with the humorous<br>shirts<br>uh it said geography t-shirts with City<br>or Regional landmarks or slogans can be<br>popular with people from that area or<br>who have visited there so it understands<br>context at least with geography<br>and last it says art if you're an artist<br>you could create t-shirts featuring your<br>own artwork<br>these are just a few ideas to get you<br>started the best Niche for you will<br>depend on your interests and what you<br>think will sell well so it is<br>interesting that it does leave it kind<br>of like Dynamic uh it's almost like it<br>understands that it's not like a<br>one-size-fits-all fits-all response when<br>it uh responds to us so this is pretty<br>cool guys um let me know if you have any<br>other ideas for what I should be asking<br>the uh the AI tool or you know the the<br>magic AI Genie here<br>um what's the all right on the way out I<br>don't know if it's gonna answer it but<br>what's what will the best selling<br>t-shirt Niche idea of 2023 be and I'm<br>assuming it's not going to answer so<br>I'll wrap the video up as I wait yeah it<br>doesn't look like it's gonna know<br>um because I don't know if they've<br>advertised the AI for being able to<br>predict the future but it would be cool<br>oh no here it goes wait what<br>I'm sorry I'm not able to browse the<br>internet or predict future Trends all<br>right all right it cannot predict the<br>future<br>yet<br>um guys let me know if you enjoyed

We learned briefly what Chat GPT is. <br>Let's take a look at how we can use Chat GPT for data science projects.  <br>Data visualization is one of the best ways \n",
              "to understand data. <br>Seaborn is often used for statistical data visualization.   <br>We can use Chat GPT for data visualization. Let's ask  <br>Chat GPT to draw a box plot with Seaborn. \n",

              "request to the website and store the response.  <br>Next, it said to parse the HTML content. <br>And then find all book elements on the page. <br>Lastly,  it gave codes to print the information for each book. <br>This is amazing. <br>To try these codes,  <br>let's copy these codes and then paste them into this cell. <br>Let's run this cell. <br>As you can see,  <br>we have scraped the book names and prices on the site. <br>So we collected data easily from a website with Chat GPT.   <br>Lastly, we want to show you how to build a machine-learning model.   <br>Machine learning is a subfield of AI and aims to automatically develop models using data. <br>We can also build machine learning models with Chat GPT.  <br>Now let's create a logistic regression model with the iris dataset.   <br>Let's say hey Chat GPT,   <br>load the iris dataset with sci-kit-learn and then<br>build a logistic regression model to predict \n",
              "iris flower species with Python.<br> Look at that,  <br>Chat GPT started to show codes to predict iris flower species. <br>This is perfect. <br>Let's copy these codes and paste them into our notebook.  <br>Let's run this cell. <br>As you can see, the model has 100% accuracy on the test set.  <br>That's it. Thanks for watching. <br>In this video, I show you how to use Chat GPT for your data science projects. <br>I hope you enjoy it.

talk<br>about AI chat jbt and tablet it's been<br>in the headlines for the last month I<br>finally think formed an opinion on this<br>and so here I am to share it with you as<br>ever let's get started okay so by no<br>doubt you will have heard of a tool<br>called chat GPT this is me logged into<br>it already if you haven't this is<br>probably going to blow your mind so<br>pause this video go and check out this<br>talk ask it some questions and discover<br>what it's made of in this video what I<br>want to do is specifically focus in on<br>how this kind of Technology could help<br>disrupt or even Aid Tableau and or<br>people using tablet in the future and so<br>as a very simple task what you could do<br>is you go to chat DPT and ask it what is<br>Tableau that's a very simple question<br>what chargpt has done in the past is<br>it's gone on and done a bit of machine<br>learning on a corpus of Data Corpus of<br>data is just basically like a folder<br>full of information and has gained that<br>in 2021 I believe and has gone out and<br>sourced information from the internet<br>and it's used that information to build<br>what is essentially a statistic model of<br>speech and language that then enables it<br>to responds to question based on the<br>information that it has so it's not<br>actually built a Knowledge Graph it's<br>built a statistical model of how<br>language comes together alongside<br>specific topics and questions and that's<br>how it's responding and so here you get<br>a response that is for all intensive<br>purposes good enough for the everyday<br>person one paragraph straight explainer<br>perfect what you can then start to do is<br>ask it a little bit more complex things<br>so for example how do I connect<br>snowflake in Tableau and it's even able<br>to sort of work through typos or things<br>that you get wrong and it will give you<br>a step-by-step instruction on how to use<br>those two technologies to begin together<br>and more often than not this comes back<br>99 of the time correct and so this is a<br>really really good way of kind of using<br>this tool as a conversational assistance<br>the other thing I think this tool does<br>really well is you can ask follow-on<br>questions for example<br>um how would I set up that connection<br>with more security so what I've done<br>here is I've asked I've asked the chat<br>GPT to essentially Carry On from where<br>it's left with that particular question<br>and I can just say well how do I add<br>more security to that connection and so<br>here there are a few key ways you can<br>set up more secure connects with your<br>tablet and snowflake use a secure<br>connection original let's wait for the<br>Second Step here use a private Network<br>um if you're using a private node to<br>connect to Tableau something like a VPN<br>then people can't sort of Snoop on your<br>conversation use level level security<br>that's specifically looking at the<br>actual data that you're getting access<br>to I use single sign-on to sign into<br>Snowflake and Tableau so things a little<br>bit better and so as a conversational<br>tool I think this is fantastic because<br>you can get deeper into a topic asking<br>sort of one sentence at a time to get<br>your better understanding of a<br>particular topic and I think this is<br>actually the best way to use this I can<br>almost imagine this as a conversational<br>AI in your ear with a with an airport or<br>something you just talking out loud and<br>something sort of telling you how it<br>works a bit like the film her I don't<br>know if you've watched it if you haven't<br>that's a great film you should go watch<br>to me this kind of technology is almost<br>in that realm it's really really good<br>and it starts to fall over when you get<br>into sort of more complex questions for<br>example how would you<br>configure a snowflake driver for Tableau<br>server okay so there's a definitely<br>going to be some typos in there to<br>configure snowflake drive for tablet<br>server follow these steps download the<br>snowflake adbc driver install the adpc<br>driver and it goes through the steps and<br>you can essentially get to a point where<br>it essentially trips up on some of these<br>steps and it tries to give instructions<br>on how to do things now in this in this<br>particular set of instructions it's made<br>an assumption that I'm using Tableau<br>server for Windows in order to do this<br>and um the other interesting thing is as<br>it gets more and more complex and more<br>complex questions you ask it there's a<br>higher risk that one of these points is<br>not actually factually correct but<br>actually still doing a pretty good job<br>of detailing out everything I need to<br>know to bring these two capabilities<br>together and it just keeps on going and<br>in essence if you don't know anything<br>about this topic what I always say is<br>the more it gives you the more rest that<br>the something is wrong and you're going<br>to make a mistake so you do actually<br>need to know this topic well in order to<br>actually make use of this which makes it<br>pointless because if you know this topic<br>well why would you come here to<br>understand how it works that's where<br>this sort of tool falls down and I think<br>it's a very interesting capability but<br>it's got its own sort of words of<br>caution but that doesn't mean I don't<br>think it's useful I'll come back to that<br>point a little later on<br>what I want to move on to next is how is<br>this technology going to work inside of<br>tablet and the answer is it's already<br>working inside a tablet if I go over to<br>the tablets page for AI and analytics<br>you can see they have a page already<br>that talks about this so I want I'd love<br>to know the web analytics behind this<br>particular page in the last month has it<br>gone up have people searched for these<br>two topics on this page come up at the<br>top I wonder but tablet actually themes<br>its Ai and capabilities in three general<br>areas augmented analytics business<br>science and data science probably worth<br>mentioning a a distinction between the<br>term Ai and machine learning and at this<br>point it's probably worth sort of just<br>highlighting why those two things are<br>different the key thing is machine<br>learning is a discipline inside of ai ai<br>is the broad Umbrellas of everything<br>that happens inside of a particular<br>discipline so in this case it could be<br>machine learning it could be predictive<br>modeling all of those things sit under<br>the AI banner and so Tableau has three<br>broad areas and if you scroll down it<br>actually spells out what those three<br>broad areas mean so the first one is<br>augmented analytics which means ask data<br>and explain data two very cool tools I<br>always think actually our state is<br>missing a trip our state should stop<br>trying to teach you how to use tablet by<br>showing you the pills the fields and<br>everything and should just give you what<br>you want the chart itself let you ask<br>questions let you build shots maybe even<br>suggest shots it thinks you should see<br>based on what you're asking explain data<br>is far more useful this basically looks<br>into a data set and tries to spot any<br>anomalies that are maybe either related<br>to that specific data point or<br>statistical variances in the whole<br>spread of the data it's actually a<br>pretty good tool that doing that and<br>helps people just discover those<br>insights they maybe weren't aware of<br>if we go down to business science this<br>is where I think this this sort of area<br>starts to become more a little bit um<br>hard to understand because you know<br>tablet have all these marketing terms<br>simple fast trusted integrated but when<br>you go down it talks about forecasting<br>it talks about predictive modeling<br>functions but at the same time business<br>science has been used in a bunch of<br>capabilities that relate to Einstein<br>analytics it used to be called Anson<br>analytics it's now called Tableau<br>business science and it's gone on and<br>changed names a few more times but in<br>essence uh it talks here about<br>forecasting and predictive modeling<br>which are strictly disciplines in AI but<br>they're not typically what people think<br>about when you're using Ai and these<br>this in this sort of use case you have<br>to know a lot about statistical modeling<br>to really go and use these or trust<br>these tools entirely and the very last<br>area is data science this is of course<br>giving people the ability to connect<br>their own machine learning models or<br>their own AI to table ions so here<br>you've got our python Matlab and<br>analytics extensions API these are all<br>ways of bring bringing that intelligence<br>into the platform and then using it to<br>work better so it's actually really nice<br>to tablet have this page I'm going to<br>link it in the description so you can go<br>check it out<br>but um I hinted earlier that in my<br>opinion this is just one way the tablet<br>could be using this um information they<br>could be using this technology to help<br>people and I think it makes sense from a<br>product perspective tablet have this<br>challenge where you know the early<br>adopters of Tableau were the people who<br>built dashboards are the people who go<br>out and build<br>um tools and things that people use<br>for them to get over that hump to get<br>the mass adoption to really go viral<br>something as viral as Excel to where<br>everyone knows what it is and knows how<br>to use it they really have to go to a<br>much much simpler user base and in order<br>to do that you can't expect them to be<br>opening up<br>um Tableau and doing data models that's<br>almost a step too far and businesses<br>just haven't opened up their data stages<br>and their data warehouses to people in<br>that way and so Tableau have to use Ai<br>and machine learning to surface insights<br>on behalf of people to get them using<br>the tool better and that's sort of one<br>approach they've taken<br>but I still fundamentally believe that<br>actually you can use Ai and machine<br>learning capabilities to help people<br>discover the tool better and this is<br>sort of a nuanced thing so bear with me<br>you see when we were sitting here asking<br>it questions this data was trained on a<br>corpus that was just scanned from the<br>internet a long time ago and the way<br>that chat GPT specifically the company<br>behind chat jbt openai have done this is<br>they took a technology that was actually<br>released last year called gpt3 and they<br>combined it with human input so<br>essentially they had people who were<br>editing the input and the style and the<br>responses as they came across it and<br>they did this on mass scale there's<br>actually an academic paper which I'll<br>link to that you can go check out that<br>talks about this and that's what's made<br>it a really really good tool now<br>essentially they've trained it on what<br>is a broad Corpus of data about the<br>world and it's coming back with very<br>good responses the flip side is you<br>could train this on a very specific set<br>of data and you could end up getting<br>really really valuable outputs out of<br>the system even though<br>um it maybe doesn't necessarily know<br>about things that might be new or might<br>be coming up in the future and so that's<br>where I've got the tablet help and the<br>tablet Community because if I just you<br>know restrict the scope to just what<br>Tabla has access to they've got all the<br>help documentation going back I don't<br>know how many versions<br>and the great thing about those is<br>they're version specific so you could<br>actually very easily have<br>um Tableau explain something in<br>different versions if you go out and you<br>train your own model on this specific<br>Corpus of information essentially all<br>the help documentation that you've put<br>together to help people better use the<br>tool this is a highly underused resource<br>people never really find it and what you<br>tend to find is when you go to the<br>tablet knowledge base they're linking<br>back to the help documentation when you<br>look in the tablet forums they're also<br>linking back to this and that's sort of<br>bringing me to the second data set which<br>is this the tablet Community pages also<br>have tons of questions and tons of<br>different things that people have asked<br>alongside the answers and the things<br>they're linking to so you could also use<br>that information as a way of building a<br>model for the way people are finding<br>problems and the answers that are<br>solving those problems and pairing those<br>two things you could maybe build<br>something a little bit more intelligent<br>than just ask data and explain data<br>which is instead of helping people see<br>better insights instead help people use<br>the tool better they can get to those<br>insights faster<br>it's a completely different Paradigm but<br>it's more of an educative sort of<br>approach and it's something I think<br>we've lost touch of in more recent times<br>back when I was young Microsoft Word had<br>a tool called clappy and clippy would<br>help you understand how to use Microsoft<br>Word you go to Clipper you ask it how to<br>do something and it would tell you<br>here's how to do it and it would point<br>you to the right section of the software<br>we've lost that sort of finesse in more<br>recent times with technology because I<br>think smartphones and tablets have sort<br>of forced people to make UI and<br>Technology much much simpler and that's<br>good because it makes it more accessible<br>but then it also means the capability is<br>a really powerful capabilities are<br>pushed off to the fringes and I think<br>that happens with Tableau a lot I can't<br>tell you how many people just aren't<br>aware of certain features that are<br>deployed and live right now inside of<br>tablet just the other week I actually<br>met someone who asked why is it so hard<br>to do year-on-year comparisons with<br>Tableau and in about three clicks I went<br>ahead and I show them how to do it now<br>they didn't know that the approach I<br>took was actually possible because they<br>didn't know you could create an ad hoc<br>calculation very easily to just change<br>the number from being a minus 1 to being<br>a minus 12 because we had months in the<br>view and year um we had months in the<br>view and then profit on the axis and<br>basically we're just looking at euron<br>year sales broken down by month and I<br>just changed the lookup to basically<br>look back 12 months and create a<br>duplicate of the view and there we had<br>it we had a year on year comparison and<br>you could then do difference and a bunch<br>of other things from there on using<br>percentages as well<br>and when I showed it to them they found<br>that approach easy but what they were<br>comparing it to is power bi which had<br>something baked in already and they were<br>actually comfortable doing it the more<br>complicated way if they knew it was as<br>easy as I made it look and so this is<br>where I think Tableau really could use<br>this tool use it to help surface better<br>ways of using the product hey you've<br>just created a join but we think the<br>exact same thing as a data model would<br>actually perform better and here's why<br>then an introduction to the model and<br>just have this AI paying attention to<br>what's going on in the software how<br>you're using the software how you're<br>browsing the software they already have<br>this capability in taboo server which<br>looks at what other people are using<br>that are similar to you and they're<br>surfacing that to you as recommendations<br>it's exactly the same thing but this<br>time you're actually helping people<br>better use the software and so I think<br>that's an area that could work really<br>really well the copyright issues are<br>endless if you're not tablet and you're<br>thinking of doing this I'd recommend you<br>to just do this with your own data set<br>which in my case is going to be the<br>translations of the video into text<br>essentially so going and getting the<br>audio uh transcribing the whole lot but<br>it's not going to be a very useful data<br>set because it's all conversation<br>there's no sort of instructional element<br>to it blogs on the other hand are a very<br>good they say if you've been writing<br>blogs for the last decade now is the<br>time to see if you can train an<br>artificial intelligence store to go and<br>maybe surface this in a way that works<br>that surfaces your blogs to people in a<br>much better way the other thing is if<br>you've created a lot of blogs over the<br>last few years it's probably worth<br>putting a copyright notice on the bottom<br>of your blog just so that when an AI or<br>tool comes to take a corpus of your blog<br>without your permission at least you<br>have some sort of protection for when<br>these tools then do fall under sort of a<br>legal Mandate of some sort because at<br>the moment it's just a free-for-all and<br>the tools just seem to be carrying out<br>and scraping whatever they want because<br>it's the internet and open internet so<br>um yeah those are my thoughts on this<br>issue it's a very nuanced issue I'd be<br>really intrigued to see where else it<br>goes but for me personally I think the<br>most useful area is just this stuff uh<br>there's so many simple things in Tableau<br>that this tool could already do today<br>you could already ask it how to do them<br>and it would already go off and explain<br>them I can't tell you how many how many<br>simple things for example<br>um how do I build a bar chart in tableau<br>I've made a two minute video on this so<br>hopefully you'd find my video and go and<br>watch it but here to build a bar chart<br>and Tableau follow these steps open<br>tablane connect your data great drag and<br>measure fields to column shelf and the<br>dimension fill to the row shelf it's<br>even specifically telling you which<br>shaft that is for example if you want to<br>create a bar chart showing the cells by<br>region you would drag the sales measure<br>to the column stuff and the region<br>dimensions of the row Shelf in the marks<br>card select bar as a mark type telling<br>you to go to the marks card if you want<br>to customize the appearance of the bar<br>chart you can then use the options in<br>the marks card to change the color size<br>and other visual properties for the buzz<br>if you want to add labels go ahead you<br>can also use the options in the columns<br>and row shelf to customize the axis for<br>your bar chart for example you can<br>change the number format axis title and<br>other options once you've finished<br>building your bar chart you can then use<br>the options in the worksheet tab to<br>customize the appearance of the chart<br>and titles and captions and save before<br>you publish your work<br>if you knew nothing about Tableau tell<br>me that isn't a much better description<br>than just going off to Google and trying<br>to find the right help and then ending<br>up stuck in a bunch of resources if you<br>don't understand any of the terms you<br>can always go ahead and follow that up<br>so you can say hey what is the marks<br>Shelf<br>and it understands you're talking about<br>Tableau and it will just go ahead and<br>tell you Intel Bay the markshop is the<br>visual element that you can use to<br>customize the appearance of behavior the<br>mark shelf is located in the marks card<br>which is found in the lower right corner<br>of the Tableau interface the lower right<br>corner of the tablet emphasize<br>oh interesting that's technically wrong<br>but I know what it's referring to it in<br>the Tableau interface there is nothing<br>on the lower right corner it all stops<br>like on the left hand side but it means<br>the most lower right thing in the<br>Tableau interface so in that respect<br>maybe the language isn't great it needs<br>to be able to just show you images and<br>you can go off to to Google and set it<br>up but it gives you an explanation okay<br>um you can also ask it where let's see<br>let's ask where is the columns Shelf<br>okay and again it understands it it<br>worked through my typo in the in Tableau<br>the column shelf is a visual element<br>that you can use to specify<br>um what to include in as columns in your<br>visualization the column shelf is<br>located in the top left corner of the<br>top table interface next to the row<br>shaft so that is actually correct<br>um and then again it gives you a little<br>bit more detail and you can go off and<br>and use it so<br>if you're new to Tableau and you're<br>stuck you don't understand how to do<br>something<br>I think more often than not this tool is<br>going to give you the right answers and<br>if you combine that with your research<br>skills and your ability to deduce<br>information from the help documentation<br>alongside the internet just doing basic<br>research Googling I can't see how you<br>would go wrong and understanding how to<br>do something yes you might get stuck you<br>might not know exactly what you're<br>trying to do you might not know exactly<br>what data set you're working with but at<br>least when it comes to the realm of just<br>understanding how to do something or<br>knowing where there's knowledge gaps<br>that you need to go off and investigate<br>I think this is a fantastic tool and I<br>can't see why people won't be using this<br>more to help them get their work done<br>faster so they can achieve what they're<br>trying to achieve and do less of messing<br>around with tools and software that<br>frankly don't matter because when the<br>Insight is what you're trying to get to<br>that's the only thing that matters and<br>therefore that's pretty much the<br>anything you remember in the entire<br>workflow three four years down the line<br>when you've forgotten all this stuff the<br>Insight is still what you'll have in<br>your mind so maybe tablets should just<br>spend more time making it until easier<br>to discover right Robin trying to add<br>more and more and more insights on top<br>of it it's

Chat GPT </td></tr><tr><td>kzvjr4OyBqA</td><td>welcome to wise cat the spreadsheet explorers channel you have surely heard<br>about it ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence with which we can chat in this video we will see what it can bring to Excel users and for<br>my part say- me in the comments if I'm obsolete and I need to convert<br>to retro gaming here we go I prepared three tests for ChatGPT and we'll see if he<br>manages to fill them here I am in ChatGPT and we're going to him ask to introduce<br>yourself that 's it for the presentation and now the first test we're going to start by<br>asking him a question about a search function here I have a table with<br>titles and prices and above a small table with a drop-down list<br>and I'm going search for the price corresponding to my title I will formulate my question in<br>this way and create an excel formula in cell B5 which searches for the price<br>of the value in A5 the matches are in A9 to 14 and the prices sought<br>are in cells B9 to B14 I'm going to ask him my question and<br>let's go offer me the velocop function that is to say in French search B I'm going to copy what he<br>offers me and I'm going to test in Excel I am going to do what it suggests to me search V<br>A5 semicolons A9 to B14 semicolons 2 semicolon false I press enter and indeed it works on the other hand if you<br>are a regular on the channel you know that it is not not the most efficient way to do<br>a search with Excel there is in Excel the X search function which is more efficient I<br>will therefore rephrase my question by telling him to use the X search function instead<br>he offers me a solution with the function search X and also note that<br>he knows that this function is only available in recent versions of Excel<br>otherwise he offers the search function V or what he calls index match in my opinion<br>it is rather index MATCH I will execute his proposed ion equals A5 Point Comma A9<br>to A14 Point Comma B9 to B14 I close the parenthesis and enter and of<br>course it works ChatGPT gave me a first answer which was correct but not efficient<br>and by insisting a little it told me gave the correct answer to my question second test a<br>test based on the filter function I have a small table with different<br>publisher titles and prices I will want to filter this data to keep only the titles<br>that belong to the image publisher j I formulated my question in this way<br>I will copy this question and return to each ChatGPT here is my question<br>and here is its answer<br>it offers me the filter function<br>here is the formula it offers me we will see it is correct we will test it = filter<br>my table that's what he proposes to me to<br>include<br>my editors and there oddly he puts me a comma in fact you have to write equal \"image\"<br>it works on the other hand his solution with a comma or a semicolon here does not work<br>not cat GPT was wrong for the third test you will see ChatGPT shine<br>writing code in our case writing VBA code I will simply ask him<br>to write me VBA code to send this file by email in PDF format and I tell him that it<br>is the tab called EP3 underscore VBA here we go here is my question and here we<br>go he is generating VBA code<br>I will retrieve the code<br>I go back to Excel visual basic developer and I will simply<br>copy the generated code as he suggested to me I will simply<br>change the destination of the email and I will put my email address I<br>run the code and I have received my file here with my PDF<br>that's all for this video don't forget to tell me in the comments if<br>I need to convert to retro gaming if you have any<br>video suggestions whether on Excel Google sheets or Power BI leave me a<br>comment and d 'here there remember that I am for the moment spreadsheetman</td></tr><tr><td>Wi5wkT3LrLs</td><td> What is the most memorable moment?<br> Fredrik, sometimes things like this happen that change everything.<br> I remember when I was 12 and got my first computer.<br> My head exploded when I saw what I could do with this machine.<br> It was a Commodore 64.<br> I remember when I first saw the web, in the early 90's, at the university in Halmstad.<br> I remember when Steve Jobs presented the iPhone, and you thought \"Shit, what's happening?\"<br> And this Friday, I remember you presenting something for me, which also just...<br> It's mind-blown, and I can also relate to these feelings, that you've had many different things that have happened during your life,<br> where you think that this changes everything. And here we are, right now.<br> And that's why we're just going to digress from this conversation, because everyone needs to know now.<br> This changes everything.<br> From today, basically.<br> From today, yes.<br> Already three days after it was launched.<br> And this is cool.<br> And what is so cool now?<br> We just talked about something that changes everything.<br> What do you mean everything?<br> What is everything now, Johan?<br> Everything. Question. What is everything?<br> Ask this all-knowing machine what everything is.<br> We are talking about OpenAI's GPT-3, which has been released for a while, but has been updated.<br> Yes, and a short story, and we can ask some more specific questions, we were just talking about this before, you and Johan,<br> and we thought we should do some research here, so we can make some statements and such, and you were like \"no, we're going to do it, we have AI,<br> we can actually use it, so we thought we would do it that way\", but a very short story is that we have OpenAI,<br> It's a foundation that was started by Elon Musk, you can check my facts here.<br> About 7 years ago.<br> They have delivered a couple of different language models, it's been going pretty fast this year.<br> A couple of years ago, GPT-2 was released.<br> And when this came, it was open sourced in a smaller model,<br> where they kept the larger model of GPT-2 behind an API.<br> Just because there were articles already two years ago<br> that this is so powerful that it is possible to do some malicious things with this.<br> You could get a...<br> Well, you think that you are now doing bad things.<br> You could get a white power association and start writing really good texts about how you can do bad things with the world.<br> You could think that the spam bots would be much more intelligent.<br> You don't need a lot of imagination to come up with bad things in MIA.<br> So that's why they chose not to open source this whole model and put it out there.<br> So that's been behind an API.<br> And it's been closed for most people for a long time.<br> They've had a research channel in, where they've been able to apply for access to this.<br> And in the summer, somewhere, they opened up GPT-3 to start playing with it.<br> And then something happened, just \"bang\".<br> Someone on Twitter wrote that it was like an atomic bomb that had hit the earth.<br> I think this is a good analogy, because something big is happening here.<br> Let's go straight to the point, I can show you here, because you asked me to fact check,<br> so I asked if Elon Musk started up an AI, and it wasn't really like that,<br> it was a group of investors and researchers, including Elon Musk,<br> who started this from the beginning, so we shouldn't give all the cred to this one.<br> And we saw a preview of this, this is what was released this Friday, this chat API, or completely open chat.<br> Because it is enough to have an account on OpenAI to access this.<br> Yes, exactly, and at the moment this is free.<br> It's also a pretty cool thing, I would say that they have actually made this open to the whole world.<br> So this chat at openai.com is open and free.<br> Let's look at how it can also look like. This is just another view of where we use the same model.<br> And there they have a playground, an openai. It's still the same domain and the same login if you were to get it.<br> You have the option to choose different models and you don't need to know a lot of technical details.<br> If you write something, you will get an answer.<br> \"May you write a web app in Python using Flask?\"<br> We can see what the answer is.<br> And now it's fun if we get an answer too.<br> With the risk that it's a bit slow right now, because we've noticed that the Americans have woken up now when we're doing this recording.<br> and then this might go a bit slower, because there is a lot of pressure on this one.<br> Yes, a lot of pressure.<br> So here you get some instructions for how to...<br> What is the general workflow here?<br> And I suspect here now, now I can't do this borderline so well,<br> but you could perhaps develop number one here,<br> how do you actually do it?<br> And that's where I think the strength is in this chat GPT.<br> Because this, I think it's in the same model behind these,<br> But if we look at the chat interface, if you ask the same question, for example<br> If we throw up... Oh, I was the one who clicked at the same time as you<br> Yes, then we test... What did you say now?<br> Write a web app in Python<br> Using Flask, is that what you said?<br> Yes<br> Let's start like that.<br> Oh, I even got some code here.<br> Exactly.<br> So we don't get the same answers, and that's cool, because it's not deterministic in that way.<br> We don't get the same answer for the same question all the time.<br> It's always different.<br> And of course, this can be very useful.<br> I've started to work on this, I'm thinking of my role as a teacher now<br> to be able to use this to generate tasks.<br> If you also have an API, you can make sure that each student gets unique tasks<br> but with the same degree of difficulty and the same general problem setting, for example.<br> And if you were to take this one step further,<br> because that's why we're sitting here, I mean, this was perhaps the least fun example we could start with.<br> I'm sorry, I'm sorry.<br> I'm the first one to come up.<br> But if we move on, I've switched to my screen.<br> I asked what's the story behind GPT-Free.<br> This is a language model,<br> and you have to be aware that that's what it's made for.<br> But if we take a more creative example,<br> what can we do with this?<br> That's also it.<br> This bomb that has been put down.<br> I want to claim this, and I might make a tough claim.<br> I, as a teacher at Linné University, an examiner, and I teach.<br> This affects so much now that from now on I don't see how we can<br> implement some type of submission tasks via submissions in the way we did before.<br> I'm not saying that this tool is wrong, I'm for these tools, I think it's good for humanity.<br> But the way we examine and have done it, we have to rethink it completely.<br> It can be a take away if you look at this, and you're a teacher,<br> really think about what kind of entry task it is.<br> - Can you problematize? - You can reset it for safety.<br> It's a bit like this, you should be aware of it, it remembers the whole conversation.<br> So it will reconnect to what you have talked about earlier.<br> So it can be good to start over.<br> And now you choose to speak Swedish here. Problematize.<br> - Can you create a school? - Yes, we can start like that.<br> - From a societal perspective. - Yes.<br> We'll try.<br> Oh my god.<br> And here we get a very...<br> For our tool it writes very good Swedish.<br> It's a little worse, I can experience, in Swedish than what I experienced it was in English.<br> But it's very, very good.<br> This actually sounds like a fairly neutral text.<br> Can't we work on this a little?<br> Yes, exactly. We can do that.<br> Write it as a poem by... Do we have any...<br> Karin Boye, let's go.<br> No, she's not. He couldn't do it.<br> Write a poem by Karin Boye.<br> I actually tested this one the day before.<br> But, Stava Boye in that way?<br> I think so.<br> IE, I think that's why she didn't find anyone.<br> [Silence]<br> - Yes. - Yes.<br> - No. - No.<br> - It was strange, because this worked before. - Yes.<br> - But, write the text as if it were written by a twelve year old.<br> [Silence]<br> And now you're struggling like a 12-year-old too.<br> What a boring introduction we got here now,<br> after being flabbergasted all morning.<br> -What should we do instead? -I'll try to...<br> I'll switch to mine, because I'll try to write an essay on the First World War.<br> And you should be aware that, again, this essay we're getting here<br> It has never existed in this way before.<br> We can take the opinions here, but we won't find them here.<br> So if we have any plagiarism control, it won't take it.<br> \"Write this as if a twelve-year-old...\"<br> \"...had written the text.\"<br> For me, it worked. I don't know why.<br> But what you see here is that you get a completely different usage of language.<br> Which is much simpler, shorter sentences.<br> Use a different language here. \"The war was very tough and many soldiers and civilians died.\"<br> That sounds like a 12 year old would have written that.<br> This text up here, you could have seen it.<br> Do you think there's a 12 year old who's using this right now? On a task?<br> I wouldn't be surprised by that.<br> I think we should just assume that everyone is using this.<br> It would be weird if people didn't.<br> So from a teacher's perspective, if you have a given task and submit it,<br> you should sit down and try to ask these questions yourself in the AI.<br> And then you realize that it's going to be quite difficult, or even impossible, to actually decide if it's an AI that has written this or if it's the student who has written it.<br> Which means...<br> You start to problematize a bit here and compare with the war in Ukraine, and then we get that in as well.<br> Your AI was a little nicer to you than it was to me here now.<br> Yes, it may have seen through your... you've had some bad intentions or something.<br> Yes, I have tried to use some bad expressions in this. You have that too, right?<br> Yes, but let's try to write about this as a poem by Karin Boje.<br> In the war we killed each other and saw the truth for death and hatred.<br> We believed in our cause and struggle and died in millions for it.<br> But now in retrospect we see that we were blind to our own hatred and betrayal.<br> for what we once called \"victory\".<br> I might not be reading this correctly,<br> I'm not that important.<br> But,<br> but,<br> it's fantastic fun.<br> You can see it's clipping here, I think there's some<br> limitation on the number of characters.<br> But,<br> but,<br> it's very impressive.<br> Fredrik, do you usually<br> hold presentations?<br> It happens that I do.<br> What are you presenting them about?<br> We could say \"Internet of Things\"<br> Is there anything else you want to add?<br> Sustainability<br> Focus on, maybe?<br> Yes<br> And this is pretty cool. Sure, now it's text that you could think of producing yourself, but<br> this is a very specific area, and those who work in this have a good grasp of it, but otherwise not.<br> A powerpoint presentation of this<br> It couldn't do that<br> You can do meeting notes or lecture notes<br> Create presentation notes of what's on the screen<br> We can get some points that we can use to make a PowerPoint presentation.<br> And get some bullet points.<br> And now we're going to do it in Swedish.<br> And I have to say that it's quite fantastic.<br> It took me a whole day to understand that it could speak Swedish.<br> It's not like the documentation said that it could speak Swedish.<br> This is a model that I've trained on a lot of texts on the internet.<br> And this is also pretty cool, this is a model that is trained on a lot of text.<br> It is not trained on a single language, but on many different languages, so it can many different languages.<br> So you can write translations to English.<br> And here, exactly.<br> And...<br> Ehm...<br> Ehm...<br> What's the name of that language?<br> Coconominomomom... What's it called?<br> The fox language?<br> Fox language.<br> That would be fun if it could.<br> Have you tried it?<br> No, I haven't.<br> Oh well.<br> Let's see...<br> Internet of Things here.<br> It wanted to talk about what the \"red-man\" language was for those who were unaware.<br> This is quite fantastic. You thought it was really fun.<br> - Oh, what's happening here? - We have a lot of interlude.<br> Just to show. It's possible to write the \"red-man\" language here with AIN.<br> And we're still speaking Swedish here.<br> And of the things we've been going through here now, when we've been able to test this during the weekend,<br> The problem is that the Swedish language is more limited.<br> Sometimes you get some...<br> What should I say? Some language errors.<br> I think that one of the examples that appeared here before was \"en\" instead of \"ett\"<br> He saw it a bit quickly.<br> And here's a sketch.<br> Aha, so they interpret Swedish Chef as a Swedish chef who speaks Swedish.<br> It's just water in the mix.<br> So here we have a story, we can use this for goodnight stories, we've seen examples of that.<br> You can write...<br> Let's look at the most here.<br> But this tool is here.<br> Yes, and that's why we want to share this information now and here<br> Because it is here now<br> And it wasn't here 3 days ago, when this tool wasn't available<br> And now it's here<br> And that means that in the current situation, depending on what domain you're in<br> In our domain, the data science domain<br> For example, we have programming assignments for our students.<br> First year students and all the way up.<br> And how can such a programming assignment be?<br> It can often be that you are solving a mathematical problem with programming.<br> And if we now try to put in something like this, we could...<br> What do we have now?<br> Do you have a JavaScript example? Like the \"Hello World\" task?<br> Yes, absolutely. We could take \"Write a Hello World\"<br> We can take it in English instead<br> But even more difficult, we can take \"write a v3c\"<br> This is much more advanced then<br> \"write a v3c web component\"<br> \"that shows that\"<br> \"gets the users name\"<br> \"web component that is a login\"<br> \"login form for instance\"<br> We can test that<br> Then we have to find a template code here, first and foremost, for how this login field should look like.<br> With a form, it looks completely correct. It uses the right password with type \"password\".<br> It has a login button. Then it builds a web component.<br> This is a standard web component, not so commonly used.<br> Many users may use React to do this or something else, but this also looks good.<br> On Submit we will receive these parts and then we will have to handle them ourselves.<br> We are not talking about what to do when using another solution, we are just writing to handle this and then define this as a component in the web browser called LoginForm.<br> Then we can use this. So this is even an example of how we could think of using this.<br> Translate<br> So we are going to change this to React code instead<br> I'm not proficient in React, but this looks pretty good<br> It uses JSX instead<br> On the template<br> Nice and pretty, and here I get an example of how I can use this<br> And just to show, while you were doing this, I'm not using the exact same question, I couldn't write it<br> But now I took another one, write a replication as data in a graph<br> And then I get a component here<br> And then I want to change language<br> So I get Python here instead, and now it's not a web application<br> But I can still use this to solve relatively complex programming tasks<br> And you can also break things down into parts.<br> And the cool thing is that you can pick up existing code,<br> paste it in,<br> and then refactor it to make the code better.<br> And it's pretty cool.<br> But now we're talking about computer science.<br> What else do we have?<br> I'll just test one more thing, if you switch over to me.<br> We don't know if this works, but...<br> -And the goal must be... -A course plan for programming.<br> Four exam questions and a clear goal.<br> That's exactly what...<br> \"Basic knowledge in programming and problems with computers.\"<br> \"Learn the basics in Python and Java.\"<br> \"To participate in a program to solve the course content.\"<br> I even get a weekly plan of what we start going through every week.<br> And how the examination should be, four assignments.<br> And then it seems like there is a limit on the number of signs.<br> But then you can split this up and choose to get out sub-goals.<br> Just like this, \"Suggest an examination assignment to the teacher above\".<br> Now it was a little tired. We have seen a little today, as I said, that it has to think a little more sometimes.<br> But the thing is, we've been testing it in the morning.<br> We've tried to write, simply take the university assignment,<br> type it in here and also get it to refer in a correct way.<br> So it creates references to all the statements in the text and so on.<br> Here we even get to start with some headlines too.<br> I don't know what it's doing here, but it generates some assignments for us<br> that we could use in this course<br> I can show you here, I'm asking AI to write a song<br> Blowing in the wind by Bob Dylan, so it's about the future state of AI<br> Here's an example song of Blowing in the wind could be rewritten to be about the future state of AI<br> How many robots must society build? And so on<br> \"Before it's considered advanced\"<br> That's funny<br> I like Rammstein as well<br> And it's also about linguistics<br> \"Write the song Dohast by Rammstein\"<br> I think it's enough to write \"Du hast\" now, because I think that's...<br> I get that. What is it about?<br> Well, what could we talk about? Academic life.<br> You get to go now, because you're German, not my strong side.<br> \"Ich bin\", yes, exactly.<br> I learn, I learn, I learn, I learn every day. You ask, you ask, you ask me always on.<br> But we don't really need to understand this, we can still ask.<br> Right, translate it.<br> And then we can see what we get. And then we get this one.<br> And this is also an example of how we can get AI to be a bit creative.<br> And this is just fantastic fun.<br> It's also a tool that you can have a lot of fun with.<br> You can also write numbers.<br> It's also a thing like that.<br> You can write wagtails and you can write any song you want.<br> And use this.<br> But the big thing here, why we're talking about this, is again the education situation.<br> That if we...<br> Just this, that all types of admission tasks, all types of examination tasks that we do as a kind of admission at a distance,<br> I would like to claim that they become incredibly difficult to examine.<br> If we assume that the students have these tools, we have a problem.<br> If that's what we want to examine.<br> That's the bigger question, Johan.<br> What kind of knowledge do we want to examine?<br> To produce this type of, if it's in code or text, it's relative.<br> It's not strange to use a spelling check in a speech therapist.<br> And it's not spelling we should be correcting.<br> It's about examining the entire submission.<br> It feels like it's getting very difficult.<br> It's about taking this in a different way.<br> Put together students who have had similar tasks.<br> Put them in seminar groups.<br> Be part of an active examination where you are expected to participate.<br> have oral examinations, I think it's very good to have oral examinations and try to have it on as many courses as possible.<br> To talk to the student and use it as a basis for the examination.<br> Is it completely objective at an oral examination?<br> No, maybe not 100%, but I would still say that it is sufficiently objective.<br> If you have a clean entry form and a home tent, you can see the problem here.<br> Otherwise, we will end up in a situation where we have a tent where you sit in a room without any available help.<br> Then you can think that it could work, for now.<br> But, I mean, Elon Musk was there and financed this.<br> We have Neuralink, which he also finances, so who knows how people will be connected in the future.<br> It might be difficult to prevent a tentative...<br> But you're asking AI, of course.<br> Yes, exactly. I'm thinking...<br> I'm asking if we can get a proposal on how we could do examinations when we have an AI here.<br> Automated grading, personal testing, adaptive testing, online proctoring with AI.<br> And I think that if we are to use AI to judge AI,<br> whether it's AI or not, then it's a race all the time.<br> It may not be a successful way, and that's not how we should work.<br> I think we need to take a grip and see what is important for the profession.<br> Because it's cool here now, if we look at what's happening.<br> We can see this from our role as a teacher, the university role.<br> But this is a tool that already changes the game plan for the entire profession.<br> If you work as a communicator and you're going to summarize some kind of text and be creative and such,<br> you can create poems from this. You can do so much with this material.<br> So I think we'll see a lot of things happen very soon.<br> And it's the ones who are late on this technique that end up behind.<br> So we should do everything to promote this technique so that we use it for good.<br> I think it's a must to go in and try it out just to get an idea.<br> Just because you might say, we always require references in our texts, so it's not a big problem.<br> \"I just asked this person to use a reference system on this text that he wrote\"<br> \"and then we get a very nice and nice result\"<br> Now, of course, if you were a student and wanted to use this as plagiarism<br> then I guess that's illegal.<br> I mean, that would be considered as a misleading.<br> But it's still about us having to go through this text<br> and check that these references are actually correct and so on.<br> We have noticed on some questions that it has tried to deceive you<br> So it requires a pretty good insight into the subject to be able to go through those bits.<br> Because it sounds very credible when you read it, but you have to go deep here and actually see.<br> But yes, I expect that it will be used by me today, actually, throughout the entire school system.<br> But a fantastic technique, and it frees, as you are aware of, it frees so much time.<br> Instead of writing boring bread-texts, I can do other things.<br> And just take help from this.<br> I have it open here on the side, on my screen all the time, just to see how I can respond in a friendly way.<br> On this email, for example, that I got here now.<br> And then I can just go in and change some details in there instead of writing.<br> And I know I wrote, it was also such a thing there, we can test it, it's always fun to test it again, but if we think about it now,<br> Write...<br> Write...<br> Tell a patient that is terminally ill and will die within one week<br> only using positive words and with a fun joke.<br> Hi there, I have some great news for you today. You're going to have an amazing week ahead of<br> you. In fact, you are going to have the time of your life. Why was the math book sad? Because<br> \"Because it had too many problems.\"<br> \"So, enjoy your week and don't forget to smile.\"<br> And then it actually says here,<br> \"This approach may not be appropriate for or effective for patients.\"<br> But, it's still like this, I can give it a pretty difficult task here now.<br> You're supposed to tell someone that they're going to die in a week<br> and do it with happy exclamations here now.<br> And, yes, why I took this example, I don't know.<br> But again, just to test the limits of what we can do.<br> Now you came up with something new, Johan.<br> No, I was just thinking about the speech.<br> \"Write a speech for a wedding where my sister gets married. It should be fun.\"<br> It's hard, maybe.<br> I'm trying the same thing at the same time.<br> You wrote in Swedish, right?<br> Hi everyone, welcome to this beautiful world.<br> I'm happy to be here and celebrate my sister and her new husband.<br> I can't... It was supposed to be a husband.<br> I can't let myself think back to all the fun times I've shared with my sister.<br> As children we were always uneducated.<br> We created chaos together.<br> And we haven't grown apart.<br> My sister is the best friend I'll ever have.<br> I'm so happy I've found someone who fits.<br> I'll tell my sisters to not take this as a hint, but just an example.<br> What did you get?<br> I got this, \"Good evening everyone, I'm so happy to celebrate\"<br> \"Proud of my sister, amazing person, beautiful and kind\" and so on.<br> You can have more in English, and then you can rewrite it as a private language.<br> I want you in pirate language, I think this is really fun, because you can get you in pirate language as well.<br> \"Ahoy mateys, I be thrilled to be here today and celebrate the marriage of me, beautiful sister and her new mate. I must admit, I'm a wee bit envious.\"<br> That's a bit...<br> And that's what I love about it, being able to work on it and have it in the conversation, so you can \"rewrite in Irish\" sound.<br> I don't know how this will work at all. I just thought it would be fun to see.<br> But then there are other models. We have DALI, for example, to generate images.<br> There is a system for text and speech that we could feed with this,<br> to then get a realistic reading of this with a Dutch dialect, for example.<br> To create a text that is suitable to be read in Dutch and then we can use it.<br> It became a bit of a macabre example and so on, but really the best way to understand this is to just use the service.<br> And that is chat.openai.com<br> Exactly. Cool!<br> This will lead to many exciting discussions.<br> I see that the academy will be<br> first endangered,<br> but then maybe also see what benefits this can give.<br> And the benefits are both, both disadvantages and benefits are obvious.<br> It is really a revolutionary technique.<br> But you can ask AI to help you with your studies.<br> You can put in some material and ask it to make flashcards for study, and it will generate it.<br> You can use it as a study tool, and it's a very powerful personal tool,<br> where you can sit and use it as...<br> You don't use Google, you ask an AI,<br> which gives an answer based on previous context as well.<br> As long as you have this thread open.<br> When you press \"reset thread\" or \"log out\" it disappears.<br> But it's not far-fetched to think that this AI will still adapt to your previous history and that it will be connected to you.<br> And if we talk about power, transparency and society,<br> then this is a technique that exists here.<br> And regardless of whether it would be shut down,<br> we all know that it exists.<br> And the next question is, who is going to own this technology?<br> Imagine if you, for the last 10 years, only you Johan, had access to this.<br> No one else in the world. You would have had this as a personal AI.<br> You would have been very effective. I suspect that you would have worked on a few companies as a consultant, alone, on many services in parallel.<br> Yes, you could have had your own copyright company and worked for hundreds of people.<br> You think that it's an incredibly powerful technology, but now it's out there.<br> It's been released here.<br> And the cool thing is that all people in the world with an internet connection,<br> and enough with a mobile phone, now have access to this technology.<br> Which is free right now, but it shouldn't be like that in the near future.<br> I don't know, but...<br> But you can also think of some kind of open source alternative.<br> And look at the exponential development of technology.<br> It's now the human brain and our linear thinking that doesn't really follow.<br> But this is where you almost lose the concept.<br> You used GPT-2 as a final word in the summer for your students.<br> You said it was in English for the first time, and you told us that it was an AI that generated it.<br> And that was a bit funny, because it was a bit funny.<br> There was quite a lot of mistakes, and it sounded a bit strange, and it was a strange assumption.<br> But if you had done the same speech today, six months later, no, almost six months later,<br> - I think you could get away with it.<br> - And we are now talking about the language model, which is perhaps the biggest implementation,<br> but what has happened in the last few weeks, the last few months, is that DALI came out,<br> we have stable diffusion and we have mid-journey.<br> We have three models that generate images.<br> And this is almost like magic when you start looking at this,<br> Because you write what you want it to draw.<br> It creates a picture from something. It's a unique picture every time.<br> It's amazing. You can create the most amazing dream landscapes.<br> The fact is that if you combine these two, you can actually use the output from GPT-3 to put it in.<br> Build illustrations or make books.<br> And then we're talking about transcribing and meetings and such things, lectures.<br> And we're already building some tests on that, that you automatically transcribe a video.<br> You take this transcription, put it in an AI, and then out comes, from an one-hour lecture,<br> a summary of what was discussed during the lecture.<br> Including all the questions that have come up, but in a summary text.<br> And this is just fantastic.<br> We can talk for hours about this, but the most important thing is to try it.<br> Because that's when you start to understand how powerful this is.<br> And you start with small questions, but then you realize that you can feed it<br> and give it the framework it needs to behave and take into account in its answers.<br> It's fantastic fun to work with.<br> And what are we in three months?<br> I don't even dare to guess because it's going so fast now.<br> I think we'll leave it there and everyone can try.<br> Take care! Bye!<br> [Music]<br> The End.</td></tr><tr><td>XdQpTafEkfo</td><td> Fredrik, it's been a week since we've been here, but it feels like a year.<br> Or what do you think?<br> Yes, and is it now that you should feel old?<br> The time is passing quickly, between the second and third advent<br> it hasn't passed this quickly before, I don't think.<br> It's been an intense week, we don't get to thank for all the positive and happy comments<br> both in restaurants and corridors and online. It's been fun.<br> You've been a big help with the recording we did last week.<br> And you, Fredrik, have had a hectic week, right?<br> - Yes, it has been quite a lot. The recording we did last week, it was fun.<br> That's why we did the recording, to spread the information.<br> So we really reached it.<br> And I was in GP, Göteborgs Posten was pretty fast on the ball.<br> And there was an article there at the beginning of last week.<br> It came out on Tuesday, I think.<br> And then there was Radio P4 here in Kalmar on Wednesday.<br> And this morning I heard myself on the radio when I was on my way to work.<br> And it was the science radio that had reused one of our clips.<br> And then there was actually an interview from the university professor here today,<br> who is watching and writing about this.<br> And then we had SVT up here just before we started this recording.<br> So yes, it's moving.<br> And I know I thought it was pretty... I think we said it to each other.<br> The media hasn't picked this up yet.<br> This should be something they're talking about.<br> But now it's starting to happen.<br> We were a week ahead of the media, you could say.<br> It's getting worse and worse, and we thought we'd do a follow up on last weeks recording.<br> We saw how we treated this chat GPT after three days or something.<br> We had it labbed a bit over the weekend.<br> Now we've used it in the profession, I've tested it with students,<br> We have tested it on everything from how it is to discover plagiarism.<br> We have done some initial tests with it.<br> We have tested it with score-testers, reports and so on.<br> We have tested it together with MyModel and others.<br> We can look at an example, but we can summarize some of the<br> I had some thoughts before I started to look at it.<br> Plagiarism control? No.<br> The plagiarism control we have today, no it doesn't work.<br> The client doesn't take it up.<br> We could have calculated that from the beginning, but now we have actually tested it.<br> And it doesn't look like it's a good method to pick this up.<br> And why would it be? It doesn't look after it.<br> And then it comes up, we might keep this cheat and plagiarism control as our own discussion,<br> but we've started to test what we can use AI for.<br> And I think this is something you mature into, the more we've used it.<br> In the beginning you go in and...<br> What should we start with?<br> - Yes, but start there. - What are you when they're using it?<br> - Start with the book. - I've seen an observation when you've<br> looked at social media, at people who use this, it's exactly like when Google came.<br> You didn't understand this search engine, so you used it in the same way you tried to beat a book.<br> You looked at the content detection and knew you would get a search word,<br> and then you took the word and searched. Then we've learned to use search engines much better since then.<br> Same thing here, now you take the step from the search engine into chatgpt and write your search phrases and get them answered via chatgpt.<br> And that's cool in itself, but that's only the first step.<br> Yes, and this is something completely different.<br> And it's a bit there, it takes a while before you get into it.<br> I think we were already in it last Monday, otherwise we wouldn't have been like \"wow\".<br> But it's a process that we can see in others.<br> And it can be a take away for you who are watching this video.<br> If you have tried chat GPT and think \"Oh my god, this is not so overwhelming or fantastic, it's better to use Google\"<br> Then maybe it wasn't the way you thought it was going to be used.<br> This is like a big engine that can generate text.<br> It's not a search engine.<br> Yet.<br> It's an exciting development.<br> We'll connect this with others.<br> But to process text in different ways, and it took a while for me.<br> I started by feeding it and it created text for me.<br> And that's probably the first natural step.<br> Then I've seen the next step after that.<br> But wait, I have texts that I want feedback on.<br> I've fed in my texts, and asked ChatGPT to reason about my texts.<br> Is this written on a good level? Can I rewrite it in easy Swedish?<br> Can I rework it so it's more clear?<br> Things like that, and you see the benefit of working with your own texts.<br> Let's get straight to the point, so we don't get too messy.<br> Let's show some stuff. We've tried to save some flicks.<br> It's exploded in social media, so just like you said, TikTok is full of all kinds of programming examples.<br> But we can stick to the university world, in a way.<br> I think we should start within the bubble we're in. It's always easier.<br> - So where should we start? My My Model quiz? - I think that's a great start.<br> I'll add, so we can look at it.<br> Many of you have worked in MyModel or Canvas or some other platform where you have a quiz.<br> And you can export these quizzes.<br> And you probably know if you've had this, that it takes some time to create quiz questions.<br> Especially to find reasonable answer alternatives.<br> And then it's also going to be fed in.<br> I tried it and this is just a quiz that I exported from MyModel.<br> I exported, I don't know if it was all 10 questions, 5 questions, something like that.<br> I don't know how many there are, 5 maybe.<br> So I exported them and then it summarized that this looks reasonable.<br> And then I said \"create 10 new questions\".<br> Then I get 10 new questions based on the existing questions.<br> And of course I want to have answers to the questions and then it wrote out the answers in this way.<br> That I use English now, it was just because this test was in English.<br> I would as much as possible have been able to do it in Swedish.<br> So I get the answer, but then...<br> \"Instead of answering, give me five multiple choice answers to each question.<br> One should be correct.\"<br> So I get the question, \"What is a subnet mask and how do you use it in networking?\"<br> And then I get five different answer options.<br> But I don't know which one is correct.<br> So I asked it to mark the correct answer.<br> \"And give me the questions in Aiken format.\"<br> Aiken format is a format for importing questions that you can use in MyModel.<br> And then you see that it says \"correct\" here.<br> But this is not really Aiken format, because in Aiken format the correct answer should be \"under\".<br> So I simply asked it to create a text file of this.<br> It's still not really right.<br> And here you see that it may not understand what this Aiken is, or there are different formats of it.<br> So I tried instead to create a MyModel XML format file for the first five questions.<br> Because it started to get pretty far here now, and we see that it just cuts off here, so I'm satisfied with five questions.<br> And then we see here that, yes, this one, however, I can take.<br> I can also import this directly into my model if I wanted to.<br> I also wanted it to give feedback to all incorrect answers.<br> You can't write that normally, but it can do that.<br> It has given me... Let's see if there's anything wrong.<br> I found it.<br> \"Feedback format subnet mask is not a device that connects multiple networks.\"<br> It says \"It's a 30-bit.\" It gives students some tips.<br> And then I can just copy this straight into MyModel and I have five fresh questions there.<br> So it's a very convenient tool for us as teachers to use for this.<br> You have to look through the questions, of course.<br> It can be hidden errors, we have also noticed during this week.<br> Mm.<br> And I'm also thinking of other things I've seen.<br> For example, let's see how I change here.<br> If I'm going to summarize text.<br> It's also one of those things it's good at.<br> [Pause]<br> Right, so I'm going to summarize this to bullet points.<br> I've just copy pasted this from a scientific article<br> which is about the paradigm of IoT and big data.<br> Here's the whole introduction, just copied straight in from a PDF.<br> Not all the text I see is coming, but it ended up in the middle of the sentence.<br> It doesn't matter much in this case.<br> Because now it takes this text mass and summarizes it in little bullet points.<br> So it's a pretty effective tool to summarize text.<br> And in this case it can't find it.<br> At least I wouldn't think it would.<br> But it still comes from the content I have given it.<br> \"5 bullet points and for a PowerPoint presentation\"<br> And then I get this in 5 bullet points and I get them ready to cut into a PowerPoint for example<br> It's a nice tool, it's good to be able to condense large amounts of text<br> and make it understandable.<br> So that's one area I've seen that they're quite good at.<br> And something that we did the other day, me and another teacher<br> We were also involved in this, we started to think about what happens if we feed in a student report or something.<br> And bring the criteria for the assessment for the course.<br> So here I have taken, of course, removed the students' names and anonymized it.<br> I have thrown in a text with references.<br> Then we get a summary when you just do that.<br> Then I have asked them to assess the article based on the following criteria.<br> I also leave feedback and then we see the criteria for this course.<br> After reading the article, I think I would get the E-article.<br> It shows a certain knowledge and understanding of the subject.<br> The main part of the review is in terms of quality.<br> And then it died in this case.<br> So this one gave it an E.<br> I sent in another text, did the same thing.<br> Here's a bit longer. \"Based on the criteria provided, grade a C.\"<br> And then it writes a motivation.<br> I want this in Swedish, and I want it to be summarized as an email.<br> \"Hi, I'm writing to discuss the responsibility of the development of...\"<br> Oh, right, it misunderstood me. It thought I wanted to write an email.<br> And you learn that you have to look up the wrong meaning.<br> So it actually interprets it.<br> \"Translate your feedback and put it together as an email.\"<br> \"Hi, thanks for your work with your article on A.I. Chatbots.\"<br> \"After reading it, I'll give you a C.\"<br> \"The article shows this and so on.\"<br> Of course, as always, this is a test.<br> But it could be a basis for something.<br> And we're working on it now, Fredrik.<br> We're working on a paper on this.<br> To make a more organized experiment if this actually works.<br> Yes, exactly. It was a part of this weekend's work, I would say,<br> where we said on Friday that we should test this systematically.<br> And we have started doing tests on this systematically now.<br> We don't have any results to share with us in the speaking period here now.<br> Because it's quite slow to work with the chat GPT,<br> so it takes some time to generate the results when we automate it.<br> But we have, of course...<br> There's something to explore there.<br> Yes.<br> And it's also about summarizing text.<br> I also think that it's appropriate, because it came as a letter on the post,<br> when we started to look at using this in this way,<br> can't we use this to cheat, Fredrik?<br> That's probably been the most important, or not the most important, but the most common question.<br> I think it's so speaking, and I almost laughed when I saw,<br> if you go in and look, we can maybe put the link in the video,<br> In the news, it was in Vetenskapsradion on P1, an article about the new chat GPT.<br> They had cut me in, so I was in it, and I think it was okay.<br> But the reading heading, that one, what does it say?<br> \"Cheating! AI overrides universities and inspecting authorities.\"<br> And this is where the debate starts, that we have a tool that can help us cheat.<br> And this is very interesting.<br> Because we have to define what is cheating.<br> What is cheating and what is a permissible tool or not.<br> I had a long dialogue with the university teacher when we were talking about cheating.<br> This is interesting. We might be in a place where neither you nor I have gone deep.<br> But let's start with a test.<br> It's pretty well defined in our regulations,<br> that if I, as a student,<br> take and copy someone else's text<br> and then submit it as my own,<br> then we call it plagiarism.<br> It's not allowed.<br> And it leads to discipline violations,<br> and you can be suspended from education, and so on.<br> But this is... Okay.<br> We're pretty much in agreement that this is a cheating behavior, if you will.<br> And the correct term there is \"wildly conducting the exam\".<br> That's what's in the regulations, that you consciously try to \"wildly conduct the exam\".<br> And then we raise this to the use of an AI.<br> Then we can see that there is a text that we are submitting.<br> And then we can start asking the question, \"Who wrote the text?\"<br> \"Did you, Johan, write the text recently, or was it an AI that did it?\"<br> I think you can stick to that question.<br> You see that you're rolling out text from the prompt.<br> You ask it to write a text, and then you roll out something.<br> But who is it that has instructed A to write the text?<br> It's the user.<br> And now we're in a grey zone here.<br> You could think that this is not Johan who writes this text.<br> We can almost agree on that.<br> It actually rolls out here now, without Johan touching the keyboard.<br> It's about a woman named Anna who lives in Stockholm.<br> I had no idea.<br> This was far from what I had intended to write.<br> Yes, but it's still a tool you use to write a text, to write a text.<br> And now you get a text that can be about anything, but you've still decided that it should be 400 words long, so you've given some input that it should be a text.<br> But, this is, we're really in a difficult discussion, but what I would like to get into in this discussion, when we talk about this,<br> This is a tool that can generate text.<br> In this case, the A-line does something, it is added.<br> And then there is a text model.<br> It is a large machine learning model, a neural network that generates this text after your input.<br> And that's what you do.<br> If we now take the other end of the scale, we have a chat GPT here now.<br> where we can generate texts.<br> And then we take the extremes to the other side.<br> When we think of the simplest form of AI,<br> we may not even think of it or call it AI,<br> and we can also question whether it is even an AI.<br> But we can only do that.<br> We write a text in Microsoft Word.<br> And suddenly, red appears under some words<br> where I have spelled wrong.<br> Ok, now we can't call this artificial intelligence.<br> It might be to pull it, but it has probably been used in the background to train the literacy control.<br> We've noticed that the Swedish language has become better in recent years.<br> But I can also use grammar if I forget points and turn the sentences in the wrong direction.<br> And then we have a tool that we already use quite a lot, both as teachers and students.<br> It's Grammarly, which is a great tool.<br> Which, well, it helps with writing, you can write a text and then you can get help in,<br> that it should be more academic, should use less difficult words, etc.<br> So then we're on a closer scale to something.<br> If we think like this, where do we draw the line for cheating?<br> And I'm not in favor of saying that, if we just ignore the cheating discussion now,<br> If we are to start putting a limit on technology,<br> where this limit goes will only be a grey zone and a sliding scale.<br> Because we can imagine that there will be an even better AI soon,<br> where you only need to write less and get even more.<br> And you can even write \"I have no idea what to write about,<br> do something that is really good so that I get approved in my subject in history\".<br> If you ask that question now, you might get something that is not so good.<br> But the next generation AI might know that and can answer it.<br> Should we just limit it to chat GPT then? Or should we take a model that was before that?<br> What I want to get to is that this discussion is only about technical tools.<br> We now have a technical tool that can help us handle text and play with text.<br> And the cheating discussion, that's another discussion that's not connected to the tool.<br> No. We've always, all submission tasks, it's been hard to guarantee that the one who actually submits something is the one who has produced it.<br> Whether it's a technical tool or a ghostwriter or whatever.<br> I think this is a good thing, since if we think before, before chatgpt,<br> now these tools have been around on the internet a bit before as well,<br> and I think that it's become available, but a student who has good economic conditions<br> can without any problem today hire a ghostwriter who writes to that person.<br> This is something that has probably happened during all times.<br> And now you can say that all students have access to a ghostwriter.<br> So it can also be seen in this way, that instead of being opponents and thinking \"Oh, how are we going to handle this?\"<br> It's become a democratization and a making available of a technology that only some people had access to before.<br> Those who could pay with their credit card.<br> Exactly, or had a friend or a close friend who was good at this.<br> That's also a perspective.<br> And that means that we as university teachers,<br> if we think about our bubble,<br> we really need to think about<br> how we examine, and what is the thing we examine.<br> And I think there are many answers to this.<br> It's probably not an easy answer to anything,<br> but this is just accelerating.<br> So I think this is something that is good.<br> - It's a catalyst for the debate. - Yes, we get the best chance in the world<br> to think about fundamental questions in how we teach and examine.<br> The questions have always been there, but now it's so obvious that we have to do something about it.<br> And then it's just \"Yes, good, let's go, now we have a chance to think new\".<br> That's probably the setting you should have, because the technology is here to stay.<br> Yes, and just to break it up a bit with chatgatp, I tested and asked if it could define cheating and set up 10 levels of different cheats.<br> And here we can start with using a computer instead of a pen and paper.<br> That we can use a spelling control to see if we have answered correctly. It could be a type of cheat, it depends on how you have defined it.<br> Search engines, communication tools like Slack and Discord<br> to discuss the tasks with other students.<br> We have to be clear when we use the term \"education\".<br> Then you sort it yourself at level 5.<br> An AI-agent like ChatGivet can help with difficult tasks.<br> But then it continues to take help from...<br> It seems to be a lot of \"take help from other people\".<br> It looks like it's worse.<br> Illegal methods, \"pay someone else\". That's what you're talking about.<br> false identities to level 10, use illegal methods to change results and answers<br> or influence and manipulate evaluation and assessment.<br> I interpret this as a pressure against examiners.<br> Or you go into the LADOK system.<br> I just think it's exciting. We'll ask the questions to that one as well, so we can see their perspective.<br> It was actually a very good summary here, that you got a scale on that.<br> Because it becomes a gray scale here, really.<br> And this level 5 now, to use an AI service, it has not been available for everyone.<br> So we have only got a new level in this scale.<br> If we now put it on this scale, but I think it looks quite reasonable.<br> Yes, you can work on it, but then we got something fast anyway.<br> I also thought I would like to show, because this was something that got up, wow.<br> I think we have a task here in the basic programming of the first tasks.<br> It's relatively complex, with a lot of rules for how things should be documented.<br> So what I did was... This isn't all the information,<br> but there's more information for the students.<br> I copied... Let's see if I can do this.<br> I should have prepared this, but I'll let it go.<br> I copied the task straight up and down.<br> Then we take a new thread and I press this.<br> First, we get a summary of the task,<br> which can be useful for many people,<br> because it's not always easy to take on large text.<br> It can be nice to have a summary.<br> Let's see if we can...<br> While you're writing, you can say that this summary...<br> It's a tool that we as teachers can use<br> to summarize very long and complex questions from students.<br> It's not always easy to know what they mean sometimes.<br> Or that you get a wall of text and you have to find the core and save some time.<br> Now it's answering one of the questions.<br> And this is going to be implemented in JavaScript.<br> And what's exciting, let's see if we can do it this time.<br> It has analysed and said that we want this documented with JSDoc.<br> It writes that we want to cast exceptions for certain types of events.<br> And of course it does that, and it does it in the right order.<br> It also comments on the solution so that you can understand what it does.<br> And then we get a complete calculation of it, so this task is now solved.<br> It's not like this has been so difficult to do before, because it's just googling.<br> There are already different types of solutions to this problem.<br> But I'll just show it again. I've noticed that it's a bit too overloaded.<br> But that solution, we've looked at it and several versions of it,<br> and each time it's solved in a way that's always from grade E to grade A.<br> It was even the case that my colleague had to rewrite his solution,<br> which he thought was the best, after seeing a proposal that was a little better.<br> - And that's quite fun. - It's fantastic fun.<br> But it just shows that it's possible to use this very, very powerfully.<br> That was that. Do we have anything else, Fredrik, we could talk about?<br> I think it's fun to get the debate going.<br> You can take the debate in the comments here, and we'll try to answer as best we can.<br> Yes, and that's one thing I've noticed.<br> I think everyone needs to work with the technology in some way.<br> We can maybe go back to that.<br> It's hard to understand what this means if you don't start using it.<br> Or explain to someone what the internet is.<br> It can be difficult.<br> And it's not until you actually use it that you understand what you can do with it.<br> And it's the same thing with this type of technology now, that it requires that you actually sit down and work with it.<br> And that's probably it. It is required that we keep this debate alive.<br> And I think that many are interested, many talk about it, but I'm a little afraid that many don't do it either.<br> And many who look away.<br> This doesn't concern me.<br> It's only you in the university world who need to sit and think about this.<br> It won't affect me, because I am another identity.<br> I got that question earlier, I thought it was a pretty good question.<br> What happens if the university, if you will, doesn't do anything?<br> If the university says that this is a tool that we ban,<br> We just counteract and do nothing, we just try to contain this.<br> What happens to the quality in the university world?<br> I think that the quality will deteriorate.<br> Because if you have a university that somehow sticks its head in the sand,<br> and do everything to try to stop or close down or say that you can't.<br> And we might start creating other systems that will be able to discover whether it's an AI text or not.<br> That we might rely on another AI to be able to discover this.<br> Then there is a big risk that we create for some students the world's easiest university education.<br> Then you will be able to go through an education and...<br> Oh my god, you can actually produce texts that can solve the problem.<br> You show me an AWS certification that someone had gone through with just chatgpt,<br> easily, quickly and conveniently.<br> And the fact is that, this is an even more philosophical and interesting question,<br> if you can now go through the entire university education with the help of an AI,<br> What does that mean? What is it that we're learning?<br> I think that's where it's going a bit, if it was so easy to answer the entry question with an AI.<br> Okay.<br> And it's insanely uncomfortable to ask that question yourself, because you know how you react.<br> \"I have done so much work in this task, I don't want to do it again.\"<br> But we might have to look at the facts.<br> But then we have...<br> Then we create a system where we won't produce any quality.<br> We will only be a system where we give points for things that need to be cut.<br> The student is good at using AI and cuts these things off the way.<br> But we... Yes.<br> Sure, they will be able to meet these requirements, with what tools they have.<br> But it will be quite easy to do that.<br> But if we instead look the other way, if we use this technology fully.<br> If we now say that we adopt this technology.<br> And we start to think about, okay, but the technology is here.<br> What does that mean for the labor market?<br> What competence do we need now, that we didn't need a year ago?<br> Or we could say three weeks ago as well.<br> But before AI and after AI.<br> What competence do we need?<br> Because this function, what you showed now.<br> If the task before was that, ok.<br> You still needed to know a bit about Googling.<br> But you still had to go through a lot of information and understand how to read it, and put yourself in context.<br> Now you get a lot of help from that, almost at once.<br> But what competence do you need to, one, ask the question in the correct way?<br> Now you did that, so maybe the question should be asked in a completely different way.<br> It could be an even more functional question.<br> Create a function that does this for the user.<br> Maybe that's where you should start.<br> That it may not be at the level of detail anymore.<br> Or maybe we should use this type of generated task<br> that we can generate in masses now.<br> And take in the students and they need to assess the outcome from the AI.<br> We have a tool here now that we need to have the competence to assess what AIN gives us.<br> We also need to have the competence to ask AIN about things that meet our goals and purposes.<br> We need to be able to evaluate that.<br> And it will be an even higher level of competence in some way.<br> Less detail.<br> I think that we at the university are quite good at educating on some basic details that may become less important.<br> There may be other things that are important. And then we can create even higher competence.<br> Because this is how it is, if we are now to be a competitive country and educate people in Sweden who are top,<br> We need top people from our universities in Sweden on a global labor market.<br> Our students need to use all kinds of tools.<br> It would be strange if a student in an engineering program didn't use programming.<br> If they only use paper and pen.<br> Sure, they get better at calculating with paper and pen, but then they go out to the labor market<br> and then you use computers to do simulations and calculations.<br> Of course, we have to use that at the university as well.<br> And the same thing. And it's great that you mentioned it.<br> I've tested this week. I've had a lot of teaching.<br> And we realized quite quickly that already last Monday<br> I presented this to my students and told them how we can use it.<br> I even showed them how to solve the first task with this.<br> And then I should say, in that course we also have oral examinations.<br> That's the main exam moment we have there.<br> So there we have a discussion with the students.<br> So it doesn't help if you've let someone else write the code.<br> So you won't get past that step anyway.<br> But then they have been allowed to use it here, like, freely.<br> And there are several students who have told me that they have used it as help when they watch the lectures.<br> We have a lot of lecture material recorded.<br> It's on the channel here.<br> And then they can use this to stop when there's something they don't understand.<br> And then they can just ask straight out.<br> \"I don't understand what Johan means by blah blah blah.\"<br> They get an explanation and can dig further into it if they want to know more.<br> And then they can continue to watch, which has been very helpful.<br> We've had some online... We do quizzes live, a bit like Mentometer.<br> We use something called Peer Instruction,<br> which is a more scientific model connected to how you work with this in education.<br> So we've used Peer Instruction,<br> which has partly been able to generate questions for a Peer Instruction with this.<br> But we've asked the chat GPT. I show the students the question, they vote.<br> Then they have a discussion, and then they vote again.<br> And then we've looked at what the chat GPT says.<br> In many cases, 90% of the cases, it's correct.<br> It agrees with the answers we've said are correct.<br> But in 10% of the cases, it's completely wrong.<br> But it sounds confident, and it sounds like it's right.<br> And here is the important part with this genuine basic knowledge, where you can see through this.<br> It has been shown that there are certain standards where you have removed things from the standard very late in the process,<br> but it has not caught up with it, so it still believes that this is still in the standard.<br> It could lead to it developing and not corrupting its traffic, for example, which would be bad.<br> And several such things where it goes a little bit, so you have to be careful too.<br> But it will be exciting to see how the students will experience the week before and after.<br> And that's what we need for competence. We have a new tool now.<br> And in a way, it's about how you can judge if this was a good challenge or not.<br> If it's 90% of the cases that were good, but 10% that were a bit tricky.<br> It's really important, and you can only assess that if you have a certain level of knowledge about all these methods.<br> But then again, how do you examine that?<br> It can be done in many different ways, but if you examine it in such a way that it becomes very easy to do with an AI, then it's not a good form of examination.<br> Fredrik, the debate will continue, I think.<br> And as I said, please comment, spread this as you please.<br> We see that it's important for us that Linnéa University is in this ball from the start,<br> and on the other hand, that Sweden is in this ball from the start.<br> Because it won't stop rolling.<br> We can close our eyes as much as we want, but the ball has started and that it would stop is incredible.<br> Yes, and that's also one of the reasons we're sitting here and talking Swedish.<br> A lot of education is done in English, but just that we can have a debate in Swedish in Sweden<br> about this is also quite central and important as I see it in this situation.<br> So that we can get information out to as many people as possible.<br> Fredrik, I'm going to leave now, because I have scouts here who have some conclusions.<br> It can also be a good thing, you know, you can use this for all kinds of things.<br> We are working on writing a plan for sexual assault and harassment,<br> which I think most scout corps work with all the time.<br> But look here, what I got. Perfect, something to start working with.<br> And it has even raised the issue of the need for a control of the load register before you can work with children.<br> It's a law that applies to youth employment in Sweden.<br> It's great, fun.<br> Fun to talk to you, as always.<br> I suspect that we might come back in this format.<br> So just subscribe to the channel if you don't want to miss anything.<br> There's a bit more coming out here as well.<br> Maybe we'll be back in a week, who knows.<br> Yes, maybe there will be a Christmas ending.<br> And we should mention an event as well.<br> Yes, don't forget that!<br> We have to get that out here.<br> Next week we are having an AI and chat GPT meeting in Kalmar.<br> It's going to be a short session, so already in a week, on Tuesday next week.<br> And you can say that this text is generated by an AI, of course.<br> And...<br> The agenda as well.<br> And also the picture that pops up in social media when you see this will also be generated.<br> And this is because we are going to catch the ball where we are.<br> And this is aimed at Kalmas IT bubble, we could say.<br> But it's not stopped there, it's clear that it's open for everyone to be a part of.<br> But come there, we...<br> - It's the application, we should say. - The application will be needed.<br> but we will also have pizza and a workshop hackathon where we explore the technology<br> and get the opportunity to meet and discuss this together.<br> So come on that next Tuesday, and we'll see you all.<br> - We will.
